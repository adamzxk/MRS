Title: In-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy of lactate as a non-invasive biomarker of dichloroacetate activity in cancer and non-cancer central nervous system disorders.
Abstract: The adverse effects of lactic acidosis in the cancer microenvironment have been increasingly recognized. Dichloroacetate (DCA) is an orally bioavailable, blood brain barrier penetrable drug that has been extensively studied in the treatment of mitochondrial neurologic conditions to reduce lactate production. Due to its effect reversing aerobic glycolysis (i.e., Warburg-effect) and thus lactic acidosis, DCA became a drug of interest in cancer as well. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a well-established, non-invasive technique that allows detection of prominent metabolic changes, such as shifts in lactate or glutamate levels. Thus, MRS is a potential radiographic biomarker to allow spatial and temporal mapping of DCA treatment. In this systematic literature review, we gathered the available evidence on the use of various MRS techniques to track metabolic changes after DCA administration in neurologic and oncologic disorders. We included in vitro, animal, and human studies. Evidence confirms that DCA has substantial effects on lactate and glutamate levels in neurologic and oncologic disease, which are detectable by both experimental and routine clinical MRS approaches. Data from mitochondrial diseases show slower lactate changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that correlate better with clinical function compared to blood. This difference is most striking in focal impairments of lactate metabolism suggesting that MRS might provide data not captured by solely monitoring blood. In summary, our findings corroborate the feasibility of MRS as a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic biomarker of DCA delivery in the CNS, that is ready to be integrated into currently ongoing and future human clinical trials using DCA.

Title: Hyperpolarized delta-[1- (13)C]gluconolactone imaging visualizes response to TERT or GABPB1 targeting therapy for glioblastoma.
Abstract: TERT promoter mutations are a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM). Accordingly, TERT and GABPB1, a subunit of the upstream mutant TERT promoter transcription factor GABP, are being considered as promising therapeutic targets in GBM. We recently reported that the expression of TERT or GABP1 modulates flux via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here, we investigated whether (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized (HP) delta- [1-(13)C]gluconolactone can serve to image the reduction in PPP flux following TERT or GABPB1 silencing. We investigated two different human GBM cell lines stably expressing shRNAs targeting TERT or GABPB1, as well as doxycycline-inducible shTERT or shGABPB1cells. MRS studies were performed on live cells and in vivo tumors, and dynamic sets of (13)C MR spectra were acquired following injection of HP delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone. HP 6-phosphogluconolactone (6PG), the product of delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone via the PPP, was significantly reduced in TERT or GABPB1-silenced cells or tumors compared to controls in all our models. Furthermore, a positive correlation between TERT expression and 6PG levels was observed. Our data indicate that HP delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone, an imaging tool with translational potential, could serve to monitor TERT expression and its silencing with therapies that target either TERT or GABPB1 in mutant TERT promoter GBM patients.

Title: Advanced MR Techniques for Preoperative Glioma Characterization: Part 2.
Abstract: Preoperative clinical MRI protocols for gliomas, brain tumors with dismal outcomes due to their infiltrative properties, still rely on conventional structural MRI, which does not deliver information on tumor genotype and is limited in the delineation of diffuse gliomas. The GliMR COST action wants to raise awareness about the state of the art of advanced MRI techniques in gliomas and their possible clinical translation. This review describes current methods, limits, and applications of advanced MRI for the preoperative assessment of glioma, summarizing the level of clinical validation of different techniques. In this second part, we review magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), MRI-PET, MR elastography (MRE), and MR-based radiomics applications. The first part of this review addresses dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, arterial spin labeling (ASL), diffusion-weighted MRI, vessel imaging, and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF).

Title: Evaluation of Two Post-Processing Analysis Methods of Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Glioma Tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive diagnostic and the neuroimaging method of choice for the noninvasive monitoring of brain metabolism in patients with glioma tumors. (1)H-MRS is a reliable and non-invasive tool used to study glioma. However, the metabolite spectra obtained by (1)H-MRS requires a specific quantification procedure for post-processing. According to our knowledge, no comparisons have yet been made between spectrum analysis software for quantification of gliomas metabolites. OBJECTIVE: Current study aims to evaluate the difference between this two common software in quantifying cerebral metabolites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this analytical study, we evaluate two post-processing software packages, java-based graphical for MR user interface packages (jMRUI) and totally automatic robust quantitation in NMR (TARQUIN) software. (1)H-MRS spectrum from the brain of patients with gliomas tumors was collected for post-processing. AMARES algorithms were conducted to metabolite qualification on jMRUI software, and TARQUIN software were implemented with automated quantification algorithms. The study included a total of 30 subjects. For quantification, subjects were divided into a normal group (n=15) and group of gliomas (n=15). RESULTS: When calculated by TARQUIN, the mean metabolites ratio was typically lower than by jMRUI. While, the mean ratio of metabolites varied when quantified by jMRUI vs. TARQUIN, both methods apparent clinical associations. CONCLUSION: TARQUIN and jMRUI are feasible choices for the post-processing of cerebral MRS data obtained from glioma tumors.

Title: 2-Hydroxyglutarate magnetic resonance spectroscopy in adult brainstem glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Adult brainstem gliomas (BSGs) are rare tumors of the CNS that are poorly understood. Upregulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in the tumor indicates the mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), which can be detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Although histological examination is required for the definitive diagnosis of BSG, 2HG-optimized MRS (2HG-MRS) may be useful, considering the difficult nature of brainstem lesion biopsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of 2HG-MRS for diagnosing IDH-mutant adult BSG. METHODS: Patients with a radiographically confirmed brainstem tumor underwent 3T MRS. A single voxel was set in the lesion with reference to the T2 or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image and analyzed according to the 2HG-tailored MRS protocol (point-resolved spectroscopic sequence; echo time 35 msec). All patients underwent intraoperative navigation-guided or CT-guided stereotactic biopsy for histopathological diagnosis. The status of IDH and H3K27M mutations was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and direct DNA sequencing. In addition, the authors examined the relationship between patients' 2HG concentrations and survival time. RESULTS: Ten patients (7 men, 3 women; median age 33.5 years) underwent 2HG-MRS and biopsy. Four patients had an H3K27M mutation and 4 had an IDH1 mutation (1 R132H canonical IDH mutation, 2 R132S and 1 R132G noncanonical IDH mutations). Two had neither H3K27M nor IDH mutations. The H3K27M and IDH mutations were mutually exclusive. Most tumors were located in the pons. There was no significant radiological difference between mutant H3K27M and IDH on a conventional MRI sequence. A 2HG concentration >/= 1.8 mM on MRS demonstrated 100% (95% CI 28%-100%) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI 42%-100%) specificity for IDH-mutant BSG (p = 0.0048). The median overall survival was 10 months in IDH-wild-type BSG patients (n = 6) and could not be estimated in IDH-mutant BSG patients (n = 4) due to the small number of deaths (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: 2HG-MRS demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of IDH-mutant BSG. In addition, 2HG-MRS may be useful for predicting the prognosis of adult BSG patients.

Title: Unique magnetic resonance spectroscopy profile of intracranial meningiomas compared to gliomas: a systematic review.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to systematically review the metabolic profile of meningiomas using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in comparison to gliomas, as measured by mean metabolite ratios. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane databases from inception to May 2021. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Eight studies were ultimately selected with 207 patients included. Fifty-nine patients were diagnosed with meningioma (age = 48.4, 66.7% female) and 148 patients diagnosed with glioma (age = 56.4, 49.2% female). Three studies reported elevated Cho/Cr in meningiomas compared to gliomas (5.71 vs. 1.46, p < 0.05, 7.02 vs. 2.62, p < 0.05, and 4.64 vs. 2.52, p = 0.001). One study reported Ala/Cr to be significantly elevated in meningiomas compared to gliomas (1.30 vs. undetectable, p < 0.001). One study reported myo-Inositol/Cr to be significantly elevated in meningiomas in comparison to gliomas (1.44 vs. 1.08, p < 0.05). One study reported Glu/Cr to be significantly elevated in meningiomas in comparison to gliomas (3.47 vs. 0.89, p = 0.002). Two studies reported Cho/NAA to be significantly elevated in meningiomas in comparison to gliomas (4.46 vs. 2.6, p = 0.004, and 5.8 vs. 2.55, p < 0.05). Two studies reported NAA/Cr was significantly elevated in gliomas compared to meningiomas (undetectable vs. 1.54, p < 0.001 and undetectable vs. 0.58, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in metabolite ratios between tumor types were reported in Cho/Cr, Ala/Cr, Glu/Cr, Cho/NAA, myoI/Cr and NAA/Cr between meningiomas and gliomas.

Title: Prognostic Value of Choline and Other Metabolites Measured Using (1)H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Gliomas: A Meta-Analysis and Systemic Review.
Abstract: Glioma is the most prevalent primary central nervous system malignant tumor, with high heterogeneity observed among different grades; therefore, non-invasive prediction of prognosis could improve the clinical management of patients with glioma. 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can estimate metabolite levels non-invasively. Multiple studies have investigated its prognostic value in gliomas; however, no consensus has been reached. PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to 20 October 2022 to identify studies investigating the prognostic value of metabolites using 1H-MRS in patients with glioma. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using the Q and I2 tests, and a fixed- or random-effects model was used to estimate the combined overall hazard ratio (HR). Funnel plots and Begg tests were used to assess publication bias. Higher choline levels were associated with shorter overall survival (HR = 2.69, 95% CI, 1.92-2.99; p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.20, 95% CI, 1.16-4.17; p = 0.02) in all patients; however, in pediatric gliomas, it showed no significant correlation with overall survival (HR = 1.60, 95% CI, 0.97-2.64; p = 0.06). The estimated choline level by 1H-MRS could be used to non-invasively predict the prognosis of patients with adult gliomas, and more studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of other metabolites.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Metabolites as Biomarkers of Disease Status in Pediatric Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) Treated with Glioma-Associated Antigen Peptide Vaccines.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are highly aggressive tumors with no currently available curative therapy. This study evaluated whether measurements of in vivo cell metabolites using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may serve as biomarkers of response to therapy, including progression. METHODS: Single-voxel MR spectra were serially acquired in two cohorts of patients with DIPG treated with radiation therapy (RT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy and prior to progression: 14 participants were enrolled in a clinical trial of adjuvant glioma-associated antigen peptide vaccines and 32 patients were enrolled who did not receive adjuvant vaccine therapy. Spearman correlations measured overall survival associations with absolute metabolite concentrations of myo-inositol (mI), creatine (Cr), and n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and their ratios relative to choline (Cho) during three specified time periods following completion of RT. Linear mixed-effects regression models evaluated the longitudinal associations between metabolite ratios and time from death (terminal decline). RESULTS: Overall survival was not associated with metabolite ratios obtained shortly after RT (1.9-3.8 months post-diagnosis) in either cohort. In the vaccine cohort, an elevated mI/Cho ratio after 2-3 doses (3.9-5.2 months post-diagnosis) was associated with longer survival (rho = 0.92, 95% CI 0.67-0.98). Scans performed up to 6 months before death showed a terminal decline in the mI/Cho ratio, with an average of 0.37 ratio/month in vaccine patients (95% CI 0.11-0.63) and 0.26 (0.04-0.48) in the non-vaccine cohort. CONCLUSION: Higher mI/Cho ratios following RT, consistent with less proliferate tumors and decreased cell turnover, were associated with longer survival, suggesting that this ratio can serve as a biomarker of prognosis following RT. This finding was seen in both cohorts, although the association with OS was detected earlier in the vaccine cohort. Increased mI/Cho (possibly reflecting immune-effector cell influx into the tumor as a mechanism of tumor response) requires further study.

Title: A new deuterium-labeled compound [2,3,4,6,6'-(2) H(5) ]-D-glucose for deuterium magnetic resonance metabolic imaging.
Abstract: Deuterium ((2) H) magnetic resonance imaging is an emerging approach for noninvasively studying glucose metabolism in vivo, which is important for understanding pathogenesis and monitoring the progression of many diseases such as tumors, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the synthesis of (2) H-labeled glucose is costly because of the expensive raw substrates and the requirement for extreme reaction conditions, making the (2) H-labeled glucose rather expensive and unaffordable for clinic use. In this study, we present a new deuterated compound, [2,3,4,6,6'-(2) H(5) ]-D-glucose, with an approximate 10-fold reduction in production costs. The synthesis route uses cheaper raw substrate methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, relies on mild reaction conditions (80 degrees C), and has higher deuterium labeling efficiency. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and mass spectroscopy experiments confirmed the successful deuterium labeling in the compound. Animal studies demonstrated that the substrate could describe the glycolytic metabolism in a glioma rat model by quantifying the downstream metabolites through (2) H-MRS on an ultrahigh field system. Comparison of the glucose metabolism characteristics was carried out between [2,3,4,6,6'-(2) H(5) ]-D-glucose and commercial [6,6'-(2) H(2) ]-D-glucose in the animal studies. This cost-effective compound will help facilitate the clinical translation of deuterium magnetic resonance imaging, and enable this powerful metabolic imaging modality to be widely used in both preclinical and clinical research and applications.

Title: Diagnostic performance of MRI perfusion and spectroscopy for brainstem glioma grading.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the roles of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion and multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in grading brainstem glioma (BSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study comprised 12 patients, including 6 with pathology verified low-grade BSGs and 6 with high-grade BSGs. We examined differences in age, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and the metabolite ratios of choline (Cho)/N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and Cho/creatine (Cr) between these two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to establish cutoff values and assess their usefulness in grading BSG. RESULTS: The Cho/NAA metabolite ratio had the strongest preoperative predictive performance for identifying the correct histological grade among BSGs, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.944 (cutoff: 3.88, sensitivity [Se]: 83.3%; specificity [Sp]: 100%), followed by the Cho/Cr ratio (cutoff: 3.08; AUC: 0.917; Se: 83.3%; Sp: 100%), rCBF (cutoff: 3.56, AUC: 0.917; Se: 83.3%; Sp: 100%), rCBV (cutoff: 3.16, AUC: 0.889; Se: 100%; Sp: 66.7%), and age (cutoff: 9.5 years, AUC: 0.889; Se: 100%; Sp: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: rCBF and rCBV values comparing solid tumors with the normal brain parenchyma and the metabolite ratios for Cho/NAA and Cho/Cre may serve as useful indices for establishing BSG grading and provide important information when determining treatment planning and prognosis in patients with BSG.

Title: Value of DWI Combined with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in the Differential Diagnosis between Recurrent Glioma and Radiation Injury: A Meta-Analysis.
Abstract: To analyse the value of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) ratio and Cho/N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) ratio in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the differential diagnosis between recurrent glioma and radiation injury. Chinese and English studies related to the diagnosis of recurrent glioma and radiation injury using DWI and MRS and published before 15 October 2022 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Journal Database, and Wanfang Database for a meta-analysis. A total of 11 articles were included in this study. ADC was lower in the recurrent glioma group than in the radiation injury group (standardized mean difference = -1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-1.87, -0.71), P < 0.001). The Cho/Cr ratio was higher in the recurrent glioma group than in the radiation injury group (weighted mean difference = 0.65, 95% CI (0.40, 0.90), and P < 0.001). The Cho/NAA ratio was higher in the recurrent glioma group than in the radiation injury group, as evidenced by the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of the Cho/Cr ratio were 0.85 (0.73-0.92) and 0.82 (0.67-0.91), respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.86. The sensitivity and specificity of the Cho/NAA ratio were 0.82 (0.66-0.91) and 0.94 (0.69-0.99), respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.93. This meta-analysis showed that ADC, Cho/Cr, and Cho/NAA ratios all had high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, DWI combined with MRS can effectively improve the diagnosis of recurrent glioma and radiation injury.

Title: Myeloid cell subpopulations compensate each other for Ccr2-deficiency in glioblastoma.
Abstract: AIMS: Glioblastomas are high-grade brain tumours that are characterised by the accumulation of brain-resident microglia and peripheral macrophages. Recruitment of these myeloid cells can be facilitated by CCR2/CCL2 signalling. Besides the well-known CCR2(+) macrophages, we have identified microglia expressing CCR2 in glioma tissues. Thus, we investigated how Ccr2-deficiency of one of the myeloid cell populations affects the other population and tumour biology. METHODS: We generated four chimeric groups to analyse single and combined Ccr2-deficiency of microglia and macrophages. On day 21 after tumour cell implantation (GL261), we conducted flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Tumour volume and metabolism were determined by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, in vitro studies were performed with primary microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages. RESULTS: We demonstrated reduced infiltration of macrophages and microglia depending on the lack of Ccr2. However, the total number of myeloid cells remained constant except for the animals with dual Ccr2-knockout. Both microglia and macrophages with Ccr2-deficiency showed impaired expression of proinflammatory molecules and altered phagocytic activity. Despite the altered immunologic phenotype caused by Ccr2-deficiency, glioma progression and metabolism were hardly affected. Alterations were detected solely in apoptosis and proliferation of tumours from animals with specific Ccr2-deficient microglia, whereas vessel stability was increased in mice with Ccr2-knockout in both cell populations. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that microglia and macrophages provide a homoeostatic balance within glioma tissue and compensate for the lack of the corresponding counterpart. Moreover, we identified that the CCR2/CCL2 axis is involved in the immunologic function of microglia and macrophages beyond its relevance for migration.

Title: Identification and Characterization of ACP-5862, the Major Circulating Active Metabolite of Acalabrutinib: Both Are Potent and Selective Covalent Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors .
Abstract: Acalabrutinib is a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. A major metabolite of acalabrutinib (M27, ACP-5862) was observed in human plasma circulation. Subsequently, the metabolite was purified from an in vitro biosynthetic reaction and shown by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be a pyrrolidine ring-opened ketone/amide. Synthesis confirmed its structure, and covalent inhibition of wild-type BTK was observed in a biochemical kinase assay. A twofold lower potency than acalabrutinib was observed but with similar high kinase selectivity. Like acalabrutinib, ACP-5862 was the most selective toward BTK relative to ibrutinib and zanubrutinib. Because of the potency, ACP-5862 covalent binding properties, and potential contribution to clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib, factors influencing acalabrutinib clearance and ACP-5862 formation and clearance were assessed. rCYP (recombinant cytochrome P450) reaction phenotyping indicated that CYP3A4 was responsible for ACP-5862 formation and metabolism. ACP-5862 formation K(m) (Michaelis constant) and V(max) were 2.78 muM and 4.13 pmol/pmol CYP3A/min, respectively. ACP-5862 intrinsic clearance was 23.6 muL/min per mg. Acalabrutinib weakly inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, and ACP-5862 weakly inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP2C19; other cytochrome P450s, UGTs (uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases), and aldehyde oxidase were not inhibited. Neither parent nor ACP-5862 strongly induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 mRNA. Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 were substrates of multidrug resistance protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein but not OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Our work indicates that ACP-5862 may contribute to clinical efficacy in acalabrutinib-treated patients and illustrates how proactive metabolite characterization allows timely assessment of drug-drug interactions and potential contributions of metabolites to pharmacological activity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work characterized the major metabolite of acalabrutinib, ACP-5862. Its contribution to the pharmacological activity of acalabrutinib was assessed based on covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase binding kinetics, kinase selectivity, and potency in cellular assays. The metabolic clearance and in vitro drug-drug interaction potential were also evaluated for both acalabrutinib and ACP-5862. The current data suggest that ACP-5862 may contribute to the clinical efficacy observed in acalabrutinib-treated patients and demonstrates the value of proactive metabolite identification and pharmacological characterization.

Title: Multiparametric Characterization of Intracranial Gliomas Using Dynamic [18F]FET-PET and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Both static and dynamic O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine-(FET)-PET and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are useful tools for grading and prognostication in gliomas. However, little is known about the potential of multimodal imaging comprising both procedures. We therefore acquired NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios in multi-voxel MRS as well as FET-PET parameters in 67 glioma patients and determined multiparametric parameter combinations. Using receiver operating characteristics, differentiation between low-grade and high-grade glioma was possible by static FET-PET (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86, p = 0.001), time-to-peak (TTP; AUC 0.79, p = 0.049), and using the Cho/Cr ratio (AUC 0.72, p = 0.039), while the multimodal analysis led to improved discrimination with an AUC of 0.97 (p = 0.001). In order to distinguish glioblastoma from non-glioblastoma, MRS (NAA/Cr ratio, AUC 0.66, p = 0.031), and dynamic FET-PET (AUC 0.88, p = 0.001) were superior to static FET imaging. The multimodal analysis increased the accuracy with an AUC of 0.97 (p < 0.001). In the survival analysis, PET parameters, but not spectroscopy, were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS, static PET p = 0.014, TTP p = 0.012), still, the multiparametric analysis, including MRS, was also useful for the prediction of OS (p = 0.002). In conclusion, FET-PET and MRS provide complementary information to better characterize gliomas before therapy, which is particularly interesting with respect to the increasing use of hybrid PET/MRI for brain tumors.

Title: Antitumor Potential of Withanolide Glycosides from Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) on Apoptosis of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells and Tube Formation in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells.
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest-growing tumor capable of spreading to other organs via blood vessels formed by endothelial cells. Apoptosis and angiogenesis-targeting therapies are attractive for cancer treatment. In this study, we aimed to study the in vitro cytotoxicity of Withania somnifera against human HCC (HepG2) cells, identify potential antitumoral withanolide glycosides from the active fraction, and elucidate cytotoxic molecular mechanisms of identified bioactive compounds. W. somnifera (Solanaceae), well-known as 'ashwagandha', is an Ayurvedic medicinal plant used to promote health and longevity, and the MeOH extract of W. somnifera root exhibited cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells during initial screening. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract and subsequent phytochemical investigation of the active n-BuOH-soluble fraction resulted in the isolation of five withanolide glycosides (1-5), including one new metabolite, withanoside XIII (1), aided by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based analysis. The new compound structure was determined by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, electronic circular dichroism, and enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, withanoside XIIIa (1a) was identified as the new aglycone (1a) of 1. Isolated withanolide glycosides 1-5 and 1a were cytotoxic toward HepG2 cells; withagenin A diglucoside (WAD) (3) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells, with cell viability less than 50% at 100 muM. WAD cytotoxicity was mediated by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Treatment with WAD increased protein expression levels of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cleaved PARP) but decreased expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, WAD inhibited tubular structure formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by inhibiting the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and its downstream pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These effects were also enhanced by co-treatment with ERK and PI3K inhibitors. Overall, these results indicate that WAD (3) induced HepG2 apoptosis and inhibited HUVEC tube formation, suggesting its potential application in treating liver cancers.

Title: Quantitative measurement of peritumoral concentrations of glutamate, N-acetyl aspartate, and lactate on magnetic resonance spectroscopy predicts glioblastoma-related refractory epilepsy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Increased extracellular glutamate is known to cause epileptic seizures in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). However, predicting whether the seizure will be refractory is difficult. The present study investigated whether evaluation of the levels of various metabolites, including glutamate, can predict the occurrence of refractory seizure in GBM by quantitative measurement of metabolite concentrations on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). METHODS: Forty patients were treated according to the same treatment protocol for primary GBM at Ehime University Hospital between April 2017 and July 2021. Of these patients, 23 underwent MRS to determine concentrations of metabolites, including glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and lactate, in the tumor periphery by applying LC-Model. The concentration of each metabolite was expressed as a ratio to creatine concentration. Patients were divided into three groups: Type A, patients with no seizures; Type B, patients with seizures that disappeared after treatment; and Type C, patients with seizures that remained unrelieved or appeared after treatment (refractory seizures). Relationships between concentrations of metabolites and seizure types were investigated. RESULTS: In 23 GBMs, seizures were confirmed in 11 patients, including Type B in four and Type C in seven. Patients with epilepsy (Type B or C) showed significantly higher glutamate and N-acetylaspartate values than did non-epilepsy patients (Type A) (p < 0.05). No significant differences in glutamate or N-acetylaspartate levels were seen between Types B and C. Conversely, Type C showed significantly higher concentrations of lactate than did Type B (p = 0.001). Cutoff values of lactate-to-creatine, glutamate-to-creatine, and N-acetylaspartate-to-creatine ratios for refractory seizure were > 1.25, > 1.09, and > 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular concentrations of glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, and lactate in the tumor periphery were significantly elevated in patients with GBM with refractory seizures. Measurement of these metabolites on MRS may predict refractory epilepsy in such patients and could be an indicator for continuing the use of antiepileptic drugs.

Title: Myxofibrosarcoma: Another mimicker of meningioma.
Abstract: Primary intracranial malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), or myxofibrosarcoma, is an extremely rare condition, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We report a case of a dural-based myxofibrosarcoma in a previously healthy 42-year-old man that was initially presumed to be an atypical meningioma. The findings based on conventional and advanced magnetic resonance sequences, including diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion weighted imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as histopathological aspects, are discussed.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy outperforms perfusion in distinguishing between pseudoprogression and disease progression in patients with glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a need to establish biomarkers that distinguish between pseudoprogression (PsP) and true tumor progression in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with chemoradiation. METHODS: We analyzed magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion data in patients with GBM with PsP or disease progression after chemoradiation. MRSI metabolites of interest included intratumoral choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), glutamate + glutamine (Glx), lactate (Lac), and creatine on the contralateral hemisphere (c-Cr). Student T-tests and area under the ROC curve analyses were used to detect group differences in metabolic ratios and their ability to predict clinical status, respectively. RESULTS: 28 subjects (63 +/- 9 years, 19 men) were evaluated. Subjects with true progression (n = 20) had decreased enhancing region mI/c-Cr (P = .011), a marker for more aggressive tumors, compared to those with PsP, which predicted tumor progression (AUC: 0.84 [0.76, 0.92]). Those with true progression had elevated Lac/Glx (P = .0009), a proxy of the Warburg effect, compared to those with PsP which predicted tumor progression (AUC: 0.84 [0.75, 0.92]). Cho/c-Cr did not distinguish between PsP and true tumor progression. Despite rCBV (AUC: 0.70 [0.60, 0.80]) and rCBF (AUC: 0.75 [0.65, 0.84]) being individually predictive of tumor response, they added no additional predictive value when combined with MRSI metabolic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating enhancing lesion MRSI measures of mI/c-Cr and Lac/Glx into brain tumor imaging protocols can distinguish between PsP and true progression and inform patient management decisions.

Title: Glioblastoma Stem-Like Cells (GSCs) with Mesenchymal Signature: Lipid Profiles of Mobile Lipids Obtained with MRS before and after Radio/Chemical Treatments.
Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) promote and are responsible for glioblastoma intratumoral heterogeneity and therapy resistance, due to their two main features: self-renewal and differentiation. Lipids have important biological and physiological functions that are critical for understanding the regulation and control of stem cell fate; lipid metabolism and related unsaturation levels play a possible role as the target of therapeutics to overcome glioblastoma radioresistance. This paper aimed at an in-depth analysis of 13 GSC mesenchymal (MES) lines, two subclones, and a stabilized glioblastoma line (T98G) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Particularly, 2D MRS was used to investigate lipid unsaturation behavior during growth in culture and after treatment with etomoxir and photon beams. MES lines, although belonging to the same genetic and metabolic cluster, showed metabolic heterogeneity when observed by MRS, focusing on lipid signals. Nonetheless, the observed unsaturation level stability for two representative lines after stressful treatments suggests unusual robustness of the unsaturation levels for each line, as a peculiar and intrinsic characteristic of GSCs.

Title: Imaging Glioblastoma Response to Radiotherapy Using 2H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Measurements of Fumarate Metabolism.
Abstract: Early detection of tumor cell death in glioblastoma following treatment with chemoradiation has the potential to distinguish between true disease progression and pseudoprogression. Tumor cell death can be detected noninvasively in vivo by imaging the production of [2,3-2H2]malate from [2,3-2H2]fumarate using 2H magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging. We show here that 2H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging measurements of [2,3-2H2]fumarate metabolism can detect tumor cell death in orthotopically implanted glioblastoma models within 48 hours following the completion of chemoradiation. Following the injection of [2,3-2H2]fumarate into tumor-bearing mice, production of [2,3-2H2]malate was measured in a human cell line-derived model and in radiosensitive and radioresistant patient-derived models of glioblastoma that were treated with temozolomide followed by targeted fractionated irradiation. The increase in the [2,3-2H2]malate/[2,3-2H2]fumarate signal ratio posttreatment, which correlated with histologic assessment of cell death, was a more sensitive indicator of treatment response than diffusion-weighted and contrast agent-enhanced 1H MRI measurements, which have been used clinically to detect responses of glioblastoma to chemoradiation. Overall, early detection of glioblastoma cell death using 2H MRI of malate production from fumarate could help improve the clinical evaluation of response to chemoradiation. SIGNIFICANCE: 2H magnetic resonance imaging of labeled fumarate metabolism can detect early evidence of tumor cell death following chemoradiation, meeting a clinical need to reliably detect treatment response in glioblastoma.

Title: Tumor Progression and Treatment-Related Changes: Radiological Diagnosis Challenges for the Evaluation of Post Treated Glioma.
Abstract: As the most common neuro-epithelial tumors of the central nervous system in adults, gliomas are highly malignant and easy to recurrence, with a dismal prognosis. Imaging studies are indispensable for tracking tumor progression (TP) or treatment-related changes (TRCs). During follow-up, distinguishing TRCs from TP in treated patients with gliomas remains challenging as both share similar clinical symptoms and morphological imaging characteristics (with new and/or increasing enhancing mass lesions) and fulfill criteria for progression. Thus, the early identification of TP and TRCs is of great significance for determining the prognosis and treatment. Histopathological biopsy is currently the gold standard for TP and TRC diagnosis. However, the invasive nature of this technique limits its clinical application. Advanced imaging methods (e.g., diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), perfusion MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), amide proton transfer (APT) and artificial intelligence (AI)) provide a non-invasive and feasible technical means for identifying of TP and TRCs at an early stage, which have recently become research hotspots. This paper reviews the current research on using the abovementioned advanced imaging methods to identify TP and TRCs of gliomas. First, the review focuses on the pathological changes of the two entities to establish a theoretical basis for imaging identification. Then, it elaborates on the application of different imaging techniques and AI in identifying the two entities. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of these techniques and methods are discussed.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy May Help Diagnose Sporadic Meningioangiomatosis Associated With Meningioma: A Case Report.
Abstract: Herein, we have presented the clinical features of meningioangiomatosis associated with meningioma, which is considered to be a rare neoplastic lesion. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) demonstrated a remarkably decreased N-acetylaspartate peak and an increase in the choline peak of the lesion, suggesting neuronal injury and active cell proliferation. These findings substantially differed from those observed in the case of pure meningioangiomatosis.

Title: Distinguishing Tumor Admixed in a Radiation Necrosis (RN) Background: (1)H and (2)H MR With a Novel Mouse Brain-Tumor/RN Model.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Distinguishing radiation necrosis (RN) from recurrent tumor remains a vexing clinical problem with important health-care consequences for neuro-oncology patients. Here, mouse models of pure tumor, pure RN, and admixed RN/tumor are employed to evaluate hydrogen ((1)H) and deuterium ((2)H) magnetic resonance methods for distinguishing RN vs. tumor. Furthermore, proof-of-principle, range-finding deuterium ((2)H) metabolic magnetic resonance is employed to assess glycolytic signatures distinguishing RN vs. tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pipeline of common quantitative (1)H MRI contrasts, including an improved magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) sequence, and (2)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) following administration of (2)H-labeled glucose, was applied to C57BL/6 mouse models of the following: (i) late time-to-onset RN, occurring 4-5 weeks post focal 50-Gy (50% isodose) Gamma Knife irradiation to the left cerebral hemisphere, (ii) glioblastoma, growing ~18-24 days post implantation of 50,000 mouse GL261 tumor cells into the left cerebral hemisphere, and (iii) mixed model, with GL261 tumor growing within a region of radiation necrosis ((1)H MRI only). Control C57BL/6 mice were also examined by (2)H metabolic magnetic resonance. RESULTS: Differences in quantitative (1)H MRI parametric values of R1, R2, ADC, and MTR comparing pure tumor vs. pure RN were all highly statistically significant. Differences in these parameter values and DCE(AUC) for tumor vs. RN in the mixed model (tumor growing in an RN background) are also all significant, demonstrating that these contrasts-in particular, MTR-can effectively distinguish tumor vs. RN. Additionally, quantitative (2)H MRS showed a highly statistically significant dominance of aerobic glycolysis (glucose ➔ lactate; fermentation, Warburg effect) in the tumor vs. oxidative respiration (glucose ➔ TCA cycle) in the RN and control brain. CONCLUSIONS: These findings, employing a pipeline of quantitative (1)H MRI contrasts and (2)H MRS following administration of (2)H-labeled glucose, suggest a pathway for substantially improving the discrimination of tumor vs. RN in the clinic.

Title: Value of Magnetic Resonance Images and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Diagnosis of Brain Tumors under Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm.
Abstract: This study was aimed to explore the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in brain tumors under the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. The two-dimensional FCM hybrid algorithm was improved to be three-dimensional. The MRI images and MRS spectra of 127 patients with brain tumors (low-grade glioma group) and 54 healthy people (healthy group) were analyzed. The results suggested that the membership matrix of the improved algorithm had lower ambiguity, higher segmentation accuracy, closer relationship of intrapixels, and stronger irrelevance of interclass pixels. Through the analysis of gray matter volume, it was found that, compared with the healthy group, the gray matter and white matter volumes in the brain of high-grade glioma were higher, and those of low-grade glioma group were lower. The improved FCM algorithm could obtain a higher accuracy of 88.64% in segmenting images. It had a higher sensitivity to gray matter changes in brain tumors, reaching 92.72%; its specificity was not much different from that of traditional FCM, which were 83.61% and 88.06%, respectively. In the diagnostic value, the area under the curve of mean kurtosis was the largest, which was 0.962 (P < 0.001). The best critical value was 0.4096, which had a greater reference significance for clinical treatment and prognosis. The ratio of choline/N-acetyl-aspartate and the ratio of choline/creatine also showed significant differences in high- and low-grade gliomas (P < 0.05), but the specificity and sensitivity were slightly lower. It also had guiding significance for the grading of gliomas. Overall, the improved FCM algorithm had obvious advantages in the segmentation process of MRI images, which provided help for the clinical diagnosis of brain tumors.

Title: Validation Study for Non-Invasive Prediction of IDH Mutation Status in Patients with Glioma Using In Vivo (1)H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Machine Learning.
Abstract: The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is an indispensable prerequisite for diagnosis of glioma (astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma) according to the WHO classification of brain tumors 2021 and is a potential therapeutic target. Usually, immunohistochemistry followed by sequencing of tumor tissue is performed for this purpose. In clinical routine, however, non-invasive determination of IDH mutation status is desirable in cases where tumor biopsy is not possible and for monitoring neuro-oncological therapies. In a previous publication, we presented reliable prediction of IDH mutation status employing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) on a 3.0 Tesla (T) scanner and machine learning in a prospective cohort of 34 glioma patients. Here, we validated this approach in an independent cohort of 67 patients, for which (1)H-MR spectra were acquired at 1.5 T between 2002 and 2007, using the same data analysis approach. Despite different technical conditions, a sensitivity of 82.6% (95% CI, 61.2-95.1%) and a specificity of 72.7% (95% CI, 57.2-85.0%) could be achieved. We concluded that our (1)H-MRS based approach can be established in a routine clinical setting with affordable effort and time, independent of technical conditions employed. Therefore, the method provides a non-invasive tool for determining IDH status that is well-applicable in an everyday clinical setting.

Title: Deuterium Metabolic Imaging Reports on TERT Expression and Early Response to Therapy in Cancer.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Telomere maintenance is a hallmark of cancer. Most tumors maintain telomere length via reactivation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression. Identifying clinically translatable imaging biomarkers of TERT can enable noninvasive assessment of tumor proliferation and response to therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used RNAi, doxycycline-inducible expression systems, and pharmacologic inhibitors to mechanistically delineate the association between TERT and metabolism in preclinical patient-derived tumor models. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2H-MRS), which is a novel, translational metabolic imaging modality, was used for imaging TERT in cells and tumor-bearing mice in vivo. RESULTS: Our results indicate that TERT expression is associated with elevated NADH in multiple cancers, including glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mechanistically, TERT acts via the metabolic regulator FOXO1 to upregulate nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase, which is the key enzyme for NAD+ biosynthesis, and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which converts NAD+ to NADH. Because NADH is essential for pyruvate flux to lactate, we show that 2H-MRS-based assessment of lactate production from [U-2H]-pyruvate reports on TERT expression in preclinical tumor models in vivo, including at clinical field strength (3T). Importantly, [U-2H]-pyruvate reports on early response to therapy in mice bearing orthotopic patient-derived gliomas at early timepoints before radiographic alterations can be visualized by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NADH is a metabolic consequence of TERT expression in cancer. Importantly, [U-2H]-pyruvate reports on early response to therapy, prior to anatomic alterations, thereby providing clinicians with a novel tool for assessment of tumor burden and treatment response in cancer.

Title: Hydrogen Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in Differential Diagnosis of Intracranial Tumors: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: Meningioma, glioma, and metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in clinical practice. In order to improve the prognosis of patients, timely diagnosis and early treatment are crucial. Hydrogen proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging can noninvasively display the biochemical information of tissues in vivo and has been applied to identify and diagnose intracranial tumors. We want to comprehensively evaluate 1H-MRS identify and diagnose intracranial tumors by meta-analysis. Some databases such as PubMed and Cochrane Library were used to systematically search articles that were about identifying and diagnosing intracranial tumors with 1H-MRS. Then, weighted mean difference (WMD) was used as an effect size to conduct meta-analysis. There are altogether nine articles, including 533 patients. Results of meta-analysis: The Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios in the LGG group were significantly lower than those in the HGG group (WMD = -0.69, 95% CI (-0.92, -0.45), P < 0.001, WMD = -0.76, 95% CI (-1.03, -0.48), P < 0.001). The Cho/Cr ratio of tumor and peritumor in the HGG group was significantly different from that in the metastasis group (0.68, 95% CI (-1.27, 2.62), P < 0.001, WMD = 0.94, 95% CI (0.41, 1.47), P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the tumor and peritumor NAA/Cr ratio between the HGG group and metastasis group (WMD = -0.64, 95% CI (-1.63, 0.34), P=0.31, WMD = -0.22, 95% CI (-0.59, 0.15), P=0.24). 1H-MRS can provide metabolic information of different intracranial tumors and can effectively diagnose and differentiate glioma and metastasis. 1H-MRS can also provide a reliable basis for the classification of glioma, and has certain clinical application value.

Title: NMR-based metabolomic profiling can differentiate follicular lymphoma from benign lymph node tissues and may be predictive of outcome.
Abstract: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a cancer of B-cells, representing the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and typically diagnosed at advanced stage in older adults. In contrast to the wide range of available molecular genetic data, limited data relating the metabolomic features of follicular lymphoma are known. Metabolomics is a promising analytical approach employing metabolites (molecules < 1 kDa in size) as potential biomarkers in cancer research. In this pilot study, we performed proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR) on 29 cases of FL and 11 control patient specimens. The resulting spectra were assessed by both unsupervised and supervised statistical methods. We report significantly discriminant metabolomic models of common metabolites distinguishing FL from control tissues. Within our FL case series, we also report discriminant metabolomic signatures predictive of progression-free survival.

Title: Imaging biomarkers of TERT or GABPB1 silencing in TERT-positive glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: TERT promoter mutations are observed in 80% of wild-type IDH glioblastoma (GBM). Moreover, the upstream TERT transcription factor GABPB1 was recently identified as a cancer-specific therapeutic target for tumors harboring a TERT promoter mutation. In that context, noninvasive imaging biomarkers are needed for the detection of TERT modulation. METHODS: Multiple GBM models were investigated as cells and in vivo tumors and the impact of TERT silencing, either directly or by targeting GABPB1, was determined using 1H and hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Changes in associated metabolic enzymes were also investigated. RESULTS: 1H-MRS revealed that lactate and glutathione (GSH) were the most significantly altered metabolites when either TERT or GABPB1 was silenced, and lactate and GSH levels were correlated with cellular TERT expression. Consistent with the drop in lactate, 13C-MRS showed that hyperpolarized [1-13C]lactate production from [1-13C]pyruvate was also reduced when TERT was silenced. Mechanistically, the reduction in GSH was associated with a reduction in pentose phosphate pathway flux, reduced activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and reduced NADPH. The drop in lactate and hyperpolarized lactate were associated with reductions in glycolytic flux, NADH, and expression/activity of GLUT1, monocarboxylate transporters, and lactate dehydrogenase A. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that MRS-detectable GSH, lactate, and lactate production could serve as metabolic biomarkers of response to emerging TERT-targeted therapies for GBM with activating TERT promoter mutations. Importantly these biomarkers are readily translatable to the clinic, and thus could ultimately improve GBM patient management.

Title: The Utility of Conventional Amino Acid PET Radiotracers in the Evaluation of Glioma Recurrence also in Comparison with MRI.
Abstract: AIM: In this comprehensive review we present an update on the most relevant studies evaluating the utility of amino acid PET radiotracers for the evaluation of glioma recurrence as compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: A literature search extended until June 2020 on the PubMed/MEDLINE literature database was conducted using the terms "high-grade glioma", "glioblastoma", "brain tumors", "positron emission tomography", "PET", "amino acid PET", "[(11)C]methyl-l-methionine", "[(18)F]fluoroethyl-tyrosine", "[(18)F]fluoro-l-dihydroxy-phenylalanine", "MET", "FET", "DOPA", "magnetic resonance imaging", "MRI", "advanced MRI", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "perfusion-weighted imaging", "diffusion-weighted imaging", "MRS", "PWI", "DWI", "hybrid PET/MR", "glioma recurrence", "pseudoprogression", "PSP", "treatment-related change", and "radiation necrosis" alone and in combination. Only original articles edited in English and about humans with at least 10 patients were included. RESULTS: Forty-four articles were finally selected. Conventional amino acid PET tracers were demonstrated to be reliable diagnostic techniques in differentiating tumor recurrence thanks to their high uptake from tumor tissue and low background in normal grey matter, giving additional and early information to standard modalities. Among them, MET-PET seems to present the highest diagnostic value but its use is limited to on-site cyclotron facilities. [(18)F]labelled amino acids, such as FDOPA and FET, were developed to provide a more suitable PET tracer for routine clinical applications, and demonstrated similar diagnostic performance. When compared to the gold standard MRI, amino acid PET provides complementary and comparable information to standard modalities and seems to represent an essential tool in the differentiation between tumor recurrence and other entities such as pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, and pseudoresponse. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the introduction of new advanced imaging techniques, the diagnosis of glioma recurrence remains challenging. In this scenario, the growing knowledge about imaging techniques and analysis, such as the combined PET/MRI and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), could represent promising tools to face this difficult and debated clinical issue.

Title: Ultra-High-Field MRI in the Diagnosis and Management of Gliomas: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Gliomas, tumors of the central nervous system, are classically diagnosed through invasive surgical biopsy and subsequent histopathological study. Innovations in ultra-high field (UHF) imaging, namely 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (7T MRI) are advancing preoperative tumor grading, visualization of intratumoral structures, and appreciation of small brain structures and lesions. OBJECTIVE: Summarize current innovative uses of UHF imaging techniques in glioma diagnostics and treatment. METHODS: A systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines was performed utilizing PubMed. Case reports and series, observational clinical trials, and randomized clinical trials written in English were included. After removing unrelated studies and those with non-human subjects, only those related to 7T MRI were independently reviewed and summarized for data extraction. Some preclinical animal models are briefly described to demonstrate future usages of ultra-high-field imaging. RESULTS: We reviewed 46 studies (43 human and 3 animal models) which reported clinical usages of UHF MRI in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. Current literature generally supports greater resolution imaging from 7T compared to 1.5T or 3T MRI, improving visualization of cerebral microbleeds and white and gray matter, and providing more precise localization for radiotherapy targeting. Additionally, studies found that diffusion or susceptibility-weighted imaging techniques applied to 7T MRI, may be used to predict tumor grade, reveal intratumoral structures such as neovasculature and microstructures like axons, and indicate isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status in preoperative imaging. Similarly, newer imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging can be performed on 7T MRI to predict tumor grading and treatment efficacy. Geometrical distortion, a known challenge of 7T MRI, was at a tolerable level in all included studies. CONCLUSION: UHF imaging has the potential to preoperatively and non-invasively grade gliomas, provide precise therapy target areas, and visualize lesions not seen on conventional MRI.

Title: Revisiting the use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in distinguishing between primary and secondary malignant tumors of the central nervous system.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional magnetic resonance images (MRI) has limitations in distinguishing primary from secondary brain tumors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) allows evaluation of the concentration of metabolites in a brain lesion and, hence, better characterization of the tumor. Considering that an accurate diagnosis determines the choice of treatment, our purpose was to assess the usefulness of spectroscopy data for differentiating between primary and secondary brain neoplasms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of 61 MRI and (1)H-MRS images of patients with histologically confirmed tumors (30 primary tumors and 31 metastatic tumors). The metabolite ratios of Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr at short TE were determined from spectroscopic curves, with a single voxel positioned in the enhancing tumor. Additional variables analyzed along with the metabolites, like as age and gender, allowed the construction of a logistic regression model to predict the tumor's nature. The statistical analysis was done using the R software (version 4.0.3 R Core Team, 2020). RESULTS: The mean NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios were higher in secondary tumors, with a good correlation between NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr (r = 0.61). The mean age of patients with primary tumors was lower than for secondary tumors (43.9 vs 55.9, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cut-off value of 0.4 for the NAA/Cr ratio with an accuracy of 73.8%, a sensitivity of 73.3% and a specificity of 74.2% in predicting metastatic tumors. CONCLUSION: The model was reasonable in predicting the nature of the tumor and provides an additional tool for analyzing brain tumors.

Title: Emerging MR Imaging and Spectroscopic Methods to Study Brain Tumor Metabolism.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) provides a non-invasive biochemical profile of brain tumors. The conventional (1)H-MRS methods present a few challenges mainly related to limited spatial coverage and low spatial and spectral resolutions. In the recent past, the advent and development of more sophisticated metabolic imaging and spectroscopic sequences have revolutionized the field of neuro-oncologic metabolomics. In this review article, we will briefly describe the scientific premises of three-dimensional echoplanar spectroscopic imaging (3D-EPSI), two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COSY), and chemical exchange saturation technique (CEST) MRI techniques. Several published studies have shown how these emerging techniques can significantly impact the management of patients with glioma by determining histologic grades, molecular profiles, planning treatment strategies, and assessing the therapeutic responses. The purpose of this review article is to summarize the potential clinical applications of these techniques in studying brain tumor metabolism.

Title: Glioma grading prediction using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics combined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation-based radiomics analysis of multiparametric MRI combined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in glioma grading. METHOD: A total of 100 patients with histologically confirmed gliomas (grade II-IV) were examined using conventional MRI, (1) H-MRS, and DTI. Tumor segmentations of T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), contrast-enhanced T1WI (T1WI+C), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping, and fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping were performed. In total, 396 radiomics features were extracted and reduced using basic tests and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The selected features of each sequence were combined, and logistic regression with ten-fold cross-validation was applied to develop the grading model. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were compared. The model developed from the training set was applied to the test set to measure accuracy. One optimal grading quantitative parameter was selected for each (1) H-MRS and DTI analysis. A radiomics nomogram model including radiomics signature, quantitative parameters, and clinical features was developed. RESULTS: T1WI+C exhibited the highest grading efficacy among single sequences (AUC, 0.92; sensitivity, 0.89; specificity, 0.85), but the efficacy of the combined model was higher (AUC, 0.97; sensitivity, 0.94; specificity, 0.91). The AUCs of all models exhibited high accuracy, and no significant differences were observed in AUCs between the training and test sets. The visualized nomogram was developed based on the combined radiomics signature and choline (Cho)/N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) from (1) H-MRS. CONCLUSION: Multiparametric MRI can be used to predict the pathological grading of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs) by combining radiomics features with quantitative parameters. The visualized nomogram may provide an intuitive assessment tool in clinical practice. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was not registered, as it was a retrospective study and was approved by the local institutional review board.

Title: High-Grade Glioma Treatment Response Monitoring Biomarkers: A Position Statement on the Evidence Supporting the Use of Advanced MRI Techniques in the Clinic, and the Latest Bench-to-Bedside Developments. Part 2: Spectroscopy, Chemical Exchange Saturation, Multiparametric Imaging, and Radiomics.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To summarize evidence for use of advanced MRI techniques as monitoring biomarkers in the clinic, and to highlight the latest bench-to-bedside developments. METHODS: The current evidence regarding the potential for monitoring biomarkers was reviewed and individual modalities of metabolism and/or chemical composition imaging discussed. Perfusion, permeability, and microstructure imaging were similarly analyzed in Part 1 of this two-part review article and are valuable reading as background to this article. We appraise the clinic readiness of all the individual modalities and consider methodologies involving machine learning (radiomics) and the combination of MRI approaches (multiparametric imaging). RESULTS: The biochemical composition of high-grade gliomas is markedly different from healthy brain tissue. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the simultaneous acquisition of an array of metabolic alterations, with choline-based ratios appearing to be consistently discriminatory in treatment response assessment, although challenges remain despite this being a mature technique. Promising directions relate to ultra-high field strengths, 2-hydroxyglutarate analysis, and the use of non-proton nuclei. Labile protons on endogenous proteins can be selectively targeted with chemical exchange saturation transfer to give high resolution images. The body of evidence for clinical application of amide proton transfer imaging has been building for a decade, but more evidence is required to confirm chemical exchange saturation transfer use as a monitoring biomarker. Multiparametric methodologies, including the incorporation of nuclear medicine techniques, combine probes measuring different tumor properties. Although potentially synergistic, the limitations of each individual modality also can be compounded, particularly in the absence of standardization. Machine learning requires large datasets with high-quality annotation; there is currently low-level evidence for monitoring biomarker clinical application. CONCLUSION: Advanced MRI techniques show huge promise in treatment response assessment. The clinical readiness analysis highlights that most monitoring biomarkers require standardized international consensus guidelines, with more facilitation regarding technique implementation and reporting in the clinic.

Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Predicting the Grade of Glioma Keeping Histopathology as the Gold Standard.
Abstract: Background Gliomas are the most prevalent intrinsic tumors of the central nervous system and are categorized from grade I to grade IV. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides exact diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of tumor response to current chemotherapy/immunotherapy and radiation therapy. With histopathology serving as the gold standard, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in predicting glioma grade. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Radiology, KRL Hospital, Islamabad, from December 15, 2019, to September 30, 2021. After providing written consent, 80 patients with untreated gliomas were included in this study. The voxel of interest was identified using MRI brain conventional contrast-enhanced sequences to assess the grade of the gliomas and link it to the histology report. Following this identification, tissue metabolites were calculated using MRS. Results The patients' age ranged from 13 to 80 years, with a mean age of 49.5 years. Male patients comprised 57.5% of the total study population, while female patients comprised 42.5%. Overall, 23.75% of patients had low-grade tumors, while 76.25% had high-grade tumors. Low-grade tumors had a choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) metabolite ratio of 1.7421, whereas high-grade tumors had an average Cho/Cr metabolite ratio of 2.5575. N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr ratio was 1.6368 in low grade and 0.6734 in high-grade tumors. Sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 84.2% were noted, with 78.75% diagnostic accuracy for the Cho/Cr ratio. Conclusions Multivoxel MRS has been shown to reliably predict the grade of gliomas despite its non-invasive nature and lack of procedural challenges. When used together Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios and histopathology can accurately determine tumor grade and can be used as a supplementary non-invasive technique.

Title: Short TE downfield magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a mouse model of brain glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Enhanced cell proliferation in tumors can be associated with altered metabolic profiles and dramatic microenvironmental changes. Downfield magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has received increasing attention due to its ability to report on labile resonances of molecules not easily detected in upfield (1) H MRS. Image-selected-in-vivo-spectroscopy-relaxation enhanced MRS (iRE-MRS) was recently introduced for acquiring short echo-time (TE) spectra. Here, iRE-MRS was used to investigate in-vivo downfield spectra in glioma-bearing mice. METHODS: Experiments were performed in vivo in an immunocompetent glioma mouse model at 9.4 T using a cryogenic coil. iRE-MRS spectra were acquired in N = 6 glioma-bearing mice (voxel size = 2.2(3)  mm(3) ) and N = 6 control mice. Spectra were modeled by a sum of Lorentzian peaks simulating known downfield resonances, and differences between controls and tumors were quantified using relative peak areas. RESULTS: Short TE tumor spectra exhibited large qualitative differences compared to control spectra. Most peaks appeared modulated, with strong attenuation of NAA ( approximately 7.82, 7.86 ppm) and changes in relative peak areas between 6.75 and 8.49 ppm. Peak areas tended to be smaller for DF(6.83) , DF(7.60) , DF(8.18) and NAA; and larger for DF(7.95) and DF(8.24) . Differences were also detected in signals resonating above 8.5 ppm, assumed to arise from NAD+. CONCLUSIONS: In-vivo downfield (1) H iRE-MRS of mouse glioma revealed differences between controls and tumor bearing mice, including in metabolites which are not easily detectable in the more commonly investigated upfield spectrum. These findings motivate future downfield MRS investigations exploring pH and exchange contributions to these differences.

Title: Final Report on Clinical Outcomes and Tumor Recurrence Patterns of a Pilot Study Assessing Efficacy of Belinostat (PXD-101) with Chemoradiation for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Belinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with blood-brain barrier permeability, anti-GBM activity, and the potential to enhance chemoradiation. The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of combining belinostat with standard-of-care therapy. Thirteen patients were enrolled in each of control and belinostat cohorts. The belinostat cohort was given a belinostat regimen (500-750 mg/m(2) 1x/day x 5 days) every three weeks (weeks 0, 3, and 6 of RT). All patients received temozolomide and radiation therapy (RT). RT margins of 5-10 mm were added to generate clinical tumor volumes and 3 mm added to create planning target volumes. Median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months for the control cohort and 18.5 months for the belinostat cohort (p = 0.53). The recurrence volumes (rGTVs) for the control cohort occurred in areas that received higher radiation doses than that in the belinostat cohort. For those belinostat patients who experienced out-of-field recurrence, tumors were detectable by spectroscopic MRI before RT. Recurrence analysis suggests better in-field control with belinostat. This study highlights the potential of belinostat as a synergistic therapeutic agent for GBM. It may be particularly beneficial to combine this radio-sensitizing effect with spectroscopic MRI-guided RT.

Title: 1H-MR spectroscopy in grading of cerebral glioma: A new view point, MRS image quality assessment.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Noninvasive preoperative prediction of histological grading is essential for clinical management of cerebral glioma. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between the image quality assessment of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and accurate grading of glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 98 glioma patients confirmed by pathology were retrospectively recruited in this single-center study. All patients underwent 1H-MRS examination at 3.0T before surgery. According to WHO standards, all cases were divided into two groups: low-grade glioma (grade I and II, 48 cases) and high-grade glioma (grades III and IV, 50 cases). The metabolite ratios in both grades were calculated before and after image quality assessment. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the capacity of each ratio in glioma grading. RESULTS: The Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr metabolite ratios had certain differences in each glioma group before and after MRS image quality assessment. In the low-grade glioma group, there was a dramatic difference in the Cho/Cr ratio before and after image quality assessment (p = 0.011). After MRS image quality assessment, the accuracy of glioma grading was significantly improved. The Cho/Cr ratio with 83.3% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity is the best index of glioma grading, with the optimal cutoff value of the Cho/Cr ratio being 3.72. CONCLUSION: The image quality of MRS does affect the metabolite ratios and the results of glioma grading. MRS image quality assessment can observably improve the accuracy rate of glioma grading. The Cho/Cr ratio has the best diagnostic performance in differentiating high-grade from low-grade glioma.

Title: Cancer Cytotoxicity of a Hybrid Hyaluronan-Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Material: An In-Vitro Evaluation.
Abstract: While hyaluronic acid encapsulating superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been reported to exhibit selective cytotoxicity toward cancer cells, it is unclear whether low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles also display such cytotoxicity. In this study, high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid was irradiated with gamma-ray, while Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles were fabricated using chemical co-precipitation. The low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid and Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles were then combined according to a previous study. Size distribution, zeta potential, and the binding between hyaluronic acid and iron oxide nanoparticles were examined using dynamic light scattering and a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ability of the fabricated low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to target cancer cells was examined using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and T2* weighted magnetic resonance images to compare iron signals in U87MG human glioblastoma and NIH3T3 normal fibroblast cell lines. Comparison showed that the present material could target U87MG cells at a higher rate than NIH3T3 control cells, with a viability inhibition rate of 34% observed at day two and no cytotoxicity observed in NIH3T3 normal fibroblasts during the three-day experimental period. Supported by mass spectrometry images confirming that the nanoparticles accumulated on the surface of cancer cells, the fabricated materials can reasonably be suggested as a candidate for both magnetic resonance imaging applications and as an injectable anticancer agent.

Title: The efficacy and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide following concurrent radio-chemotherapy among Egyptian patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: Although concurrent radio-chemotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) treatment for 6 cycles has been established as a standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, the recommended duration of adjuvant TMZ remains a matter of debate. Hereby, we aimed to report for the first time our experience from Upper Egypt through comparing survival and toxicity profile between two treatment modalities of adjuvant TMZ (> six cycles versus six cycles) and delineating factors of prognostic significance in Egyptian patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated by radiation therapy with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. Between June 2016 and February 2018, the medical records of 121 patients were eligible to be retrospectively reviewed to extract the study relevant data. All patients received concurrent radio-chemotherapy, followed by TMZ for 6 cycles in 29 patients (Group 1) and for >6 cycles in 26 patients (Group 2). Patients in Group 1 had a median PFS of 15 months (95% CI: 10.215-19.785), while those in Group 2 had a median PFS of 18 months (95% CI: 16.611-19.389). After a median follow up duration of 20 months (range: 12-41), the median OS was 18 months (95% CI: 13.420-22.580) in Group 1 and 22 months (95% CI: 18.777-25.223) in Group 2. There was no statistically significant correlation between the number of chemotherapy cycles and PFS (P=0.513) or OS (P=0.867). The extent of surgical resection was the only independent prognostic factor for both PFS (P=0.015) and OS (P=0.028) by multivariate analysis. Three grade >/=3 hematologic toxicity were encountered in 3 patients. One in the six-cycle group (neutropenia), and two in the extended cycles group (one had neutropenia and the other one developed thrombocytopenia). No statistically significant difference in the toxicity profile between both groups. The results of our study suggest that extended TMZ therapy is safe and tolerable, however it did not significantly improve PFS or OS as compared to the standard six-cycle course. Larger randomized studies are required to shed more light on this issue.

Title: 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Evaluation of Glioma and Metastases in 3T MRI.
Abstract: Background:  31-Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31-P MRS) has excellent potential for clinical neurological practice because of its noninvasive in-vivo assessment of cellular energy metabolism and the indirect evaluation of the phospholipid composition of the cell membrane, intracellular pH, and intracellular Mg2+ concentration. Purpose:  The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic characteristics of glioma and metastases using 31-P MRS and assess utility to differentiate both. Study Type:  Prospective study. Population:  Fifteen consecutive patients with brain tumor. Field Strength/Sequence:  Three-tesla magnetic resonance imaging/three-dimensional MRS imaging sequence. Statistical Tests:  Unpaired sample t -test, and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test. Results:  Significantly decreased values of phosphomonoesters/inorganic phosphate (PME/Pi) in the tumor group (1.22 +/- 0.72) compared with controls (2.28 +/- 1.44) with a p -value of 0.041 were observed. There is a significant decrease in phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi values (energy demand) in the tumor group (2.76 +/- 0.73) compared with controls (4.13 +/- 1.75) with a p -value of 0.050. Significant increase in Pi/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was noted in tumor group (0.28 +/- 0.09) compared with controls (0.22 +/- 0.08) with p -value 0.049. Among tumor group, PME/PCr values were significantly decreased in gliomas (0.35 +/- 0.17) than metastasis (0.58 +/- 0.23) compared with controls with a p -value of 0.047. A significant decrease in PME/ATP was noted in gliomas (0.25 +/- 0.12) than metastasis (0.41 +/- 0.14) compared with controls with a p -value of 0.034. The tumor group exhibits alkaline pH (7.12 +/- 0.10) compared with the normal parenchyma (7.04 +/- 0.06) with a significant p -value of 0.025. Glioma and metastasis could not be differentiated with pH. However, the perilesional edema of glioma shows alkaline pH (7.09 +/- 0.06) and metastasis shows acidic pH (7.02 +/- 0.05) with a significant p -value of 0.030. Conclusion:  Our study provides new insight into the cellular constituents and pH of gliomas and metastases and results were significant in differentiation between these two. However, due to the additional high expense, it is available as a research tool in very few institutions in India.

Title: Extracellular pH Mapping as Therapeutic Readout of Drug Delivery in Glioblastoma.
Abstract: An acidic extracellular space is a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment. Acidosis has been postulated to promote the aggressive and invasive characteristics of tumors and also inhibit the therapeutic response, particularly in the context of novel immunotherapies. Therefore, methods to quantitatively measure the extracellular pH (pH(e)) are needed. Here we describe a magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technique termed Biosensor Imaging of Redundant Deviation in Shifts (BIRDS), which uses the pH-dependent chemical shifts of nonexchangeable protons of lanthanide-based contrast agents to generate quantitative spatial pH(e) maps. We assess this method in the context of evaluating the acidic pH(e) and therapeutic response in glioblastoma in rodents, where normalization of the pH(e) upon therapy can serve as a quantitative readout of successful drug delivery to the tumor.

Title: Peripheral Skeletal Muscle Impairment in Children After Treatment for Leukemia and Lymphoma.
Abstract: Exercise intolerance is a common adverse effect of childhood cancer, contributing to impaired health and well-being. While reduced aerobic fitness has been attributed to central cardiovascular deficiencies, the involvement of peripheral musculature has not been investigated. We studied peripheral muscle function in children following cancer treatment using noninvasive phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Ten acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1 lymphoma patient 8 to 18 years of age who completed treatment 6 to 36 months prior and 11 healthy controls participated in the study. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize muscle bioenergetics at rest and following an in-magnet knee-extension exercise. Exercise capacity was evaluated using a submaximal graded treadmill test. Both analysis of variance and Cohen d were used as statistical methods to determine the statistical significance and magnitude of differences, respectively, on these parameters between the patient and control groups. The patients treated for ALL and lymphoma exhibited lower anaerobic function ( P =0.14, d =0.72), slower metabolic recovery ( P =0.08, d =0.93), and lower mechanical muscle power ( d =1.09) during exercise compared with healthy controls. Patients demonstrated lower estimated VO 2peak (41.61+/-5.97 vs. 47.71+/-9.99 mL/min/kg, P =0.11, d =0.76), lower minutes of physical activity (58.3+/-35.3 vs. 114.8+/-79.3 min, P =0.12, d =0.99) and higher minutes of inactivity (107.3+/-74.0 vs. 43.5+/-48.3 min, d =1.04, P <0.05). Children treated for ALL and lymphoma exhibit altered peripheral skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise. Both deconditioning and direct effects of chemotherapy likely contribute to exercise intolerance in this population.

Title: Glutamic Acid and Total Creatine as Predictive Markers for Epilepsy in Glioblastoma by Using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Before Surgery.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy in glioblastoma patients significantly reduces their quality of life; however, little is known about the association between predicting epilepsy and metabolites in tumors. In this study, we used 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging and (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify metabolite concentrations in patients with varying epilepsy histories. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with glioblastoma underwent pretreatment 3.0-T MRI/(1)H-MRS scanning. Single-voxel (1.5 cm(3)) MRS, in an enhanced lesion, was acquired using a double-echo point-resolved spectroscopic sequence with chemical-shift selective water suppression. MRS data were quantified with linear combination model (LC-Model) software. We compared the MRS data between groups with and without epilepsy during the postoperative course (EP). RESULTS: The ratios of glutamate (Glu) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) to total creatine (Glu/tCr and Glx/tCr) in the tumor were associated with epilepsy history. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a Glu/tCr value of 1.81 was 70% sensitive and 90% specific for the prediction of EP (area under curve: 0.82). In the analysis excluding patients with preoperative epilepsy, a Glu/tCr value of 1.81 was 75% sensitive and 88% specific for the prediction (area under curve: 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral metabolite concentrations measured using pretreatment 3.0-T MRI/(1)H-MRS changed characteristically in the group with EP. Our study suggests that the Glu/tCr ratio in tumors has adequate reliability in predicting EP. Pretreatment MRS is a minimally invasive and simple procedure that can provide useful information on glioblastoma patients.

Title: Sequential Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Patients Undergoing Reirradiation for Progressive Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging for evaluation of white matter tracts is used with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to improve management of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and tumor metabolite ratios have been reported after initial radiation for DIPG, but these markers have not been studied sequentially in patients undergoing reirradiation for progressive DIPG. Here, we report a case series of 4 patients who received reirradiation for progressive DIPG on a prospective clinical trial in which we evaluated quantitative changes in FA, ADC, and tumor metabolites and qualitative changes in white matter tracts. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The median reirradiation dose was 25.2 Gy (24-30.8 Gy). Fiber tracking was performed using standard tractography analysis. The FA and ADC values for the corticospinal and medial lemniscus tracts were calculated before and after reirradiation. Multivoxel MRS was performed. Findings were correlated with clinical features and conventional MRI of tumors. RESULTS: All patients had an initial response to reirradiation as shown by a decrease in tumor size. In general, FA increased with disease response and decreased with progression, whereas ADC decreased with disease response and increased with progression. At second progression, the FA fold change relative to values during disease response decreased in both patients with available imaging at second progression. Visualization of tracts demonstrated robust reconstitution of previously disrupted paths during tumor response; conversely, there was increased fiber tract disruption and infiltration during tumor progression. The MRS analysis revealed a decrease in choline:creatinine and choline:N-acetylaspartate ratios during tumor response and increase during progression. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct changes in white matter tracts and tumor metabolism were observed in patients with DIPG undergoing reirradiation on a prospective clinical trial. Changes related to tumor response and progression were observed after 24 to 30.8 Gy reirradiation.

Title: Glucose fluxes in glycolytic and oxidative pathways detected in vivo by deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopy reflect proliferation in mouse glioblastoma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive glial brain tumors, can metabolize glucose through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation pathways. While specific dependencies on those pathways are increasingly associated with treatment response, detecting such GBM subtypes in vivo remains elusive. Here, we develop a dynamic glucose-enhanced deuterium spectroscopy (DGE (2)H-MRS) approach for differentially assessing glucose turnover rates through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation in mouse GBM and explore their association with histologic features of the tumor and its microenvironment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GL261 and CT2A glioma allografts were induced in immunocompetent mice and scanned in vivo at 9.4 Tesla, harnessing DGE (2)H-MRS with volume selection and Marchenko-Pastur PCA (MP-PCA) denoising to achieve high temporal resolution. Each tumor was also classified by histopathologic analysis and assessed for cell proliferation (Ki67 immunostaining), while the respective cell lines underwent in situ extracellular flux analysis to assess mitochondrial function. RESULTS: MP-PCA denoising of in vivo DGE (2)H-MRS data significantly improved the time-course detection (~2-fold increased Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and fitting precision (-19 +/- 1 % Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds) of (2)H-labelled glucose, and glucose-derived glutamate-glutamine (Glx) and lactate pools in GL261 and CT2A orthotopic tumors. Kinetic modeling further indicated inter-tumor heterogeneity of glucose consumption rate for glycolysis and oxidation during a defined epoch of active proliferation in both cohorts (19 +/- 1 days post-induction), with consistent volumes (38.3 +/- 3.4 mm(3)) and perfusion properties prior to marked necrosis. Histopathologic analysis of these tumors revealed clear differences in tumor heterogeneity between the two GBM models, aligned with metabolic differences of the respective cell lines monitored in situ. Importantly, glucose oxidation (i.e. Glx synthesis and elimination rates: 0.40 +/- 0.08 and 0.12 +/- 0.03 mM min(-1), respectively) strongly correlated with cell proliferation across the pooled cohorts (R = 0.82, p = 0.001; and R = 0.80, p = 0.002, respectively), regardless of tumor morphologic features or in situ metabolic characteristics of each GBM model. CONCLUSIONS: Our fast DGE (2)H-MRS enables the quantification of glucose consumption rates through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation in mouse GBM, which is relevant for assessing their modulation in vivo according to tumor microenvironment features such as cell proliferation. This novel application augurs well for non-invasive metabolic characterization of glioma or other cancers with mitochondrial oxidation dependencies.

Title: Preclinical and clinical evaluation of German-sourced ONC201 for the treatment of H3K27M-mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal childhood brainstem tumor for which radiation is the only treatment. Case studies report a clinical response to ONC201 for patients with H3K27M-mutant gliomas. Oncoceutics (ONC201) is only available in the United States and Japan; however, in Germany, DIPG patients can be prescribed and dispensed a locally produced compound-ONC201 German-sourced ONC201 (GsONC201). Pediatric oncologists face the dilemma of supporting the administration of GsONC201 as conjecture surrounds its authenticity. Therefore, we compared GsONC201 to original ONC201 manufactured by Oncoceutics Inc. METHODS: Authenticity of GsONC201 was determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Biological activity was shown via assessment of on-target effects, in vitro growth, proliferation, and apoptosis analysis. Patient-derived xenograft mouse models were used to assess plasma and brain tissue pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and overall survival (OS). The clinical experience of 28 H3K27M+ mutant DIPG patients who received GsONC201 (2017-2020) was analyzed. RESULTS: GsONC201 harbored the authentic structure, however, was formulated as a free base rather than the dihydrochloride salt used in clinical trials. GsONC201 in vitro and in vivo efficacy and drug bioavailability studies showed no difference compared to Oncoceutics ONC201. Patients treated with GsONC201 (n = 28) showed a median OS of 18 months (P = .0007). GsONC201 patients who underwent reirradiation showed a median OS of 22 months compared to 12 months for GsONC201 patients who did not (P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the biological activity of GsONC201 and documents the OS of patients who received the drug; however, GsONC201 was never used as a monotherapy.

Title: Changes in Brain Energy and Membrane Metabolism in Glioblastoma following Chemoradiation.
Abstract: Brain parenchyma infiltration with glioblastoma (GB) cannot be entirely visualized by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the energy and membrane metabolism measured with phosphorous MR spectroscopy (31P-MRS) in the presumably "normal-appearing" brain following chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in GB patients in comparison to healthy controls. Twenty (seven female, thirteen male) GB patients underwent a 31P-MRS scan prior to surgery (baseline) and after three months of standard CRT (follow-up examination. The regions of interest "contrast-enhancing (CE) tumor" (if present), "adjacent to the (former) tumor", "ipsilateral distant" hemisphere, and "contralateral" hemisphere were compared, differentiating between patients with stable (SD) and progressive disease (PD). Metabolite ratios PCr/ATP, Pi/ATP, PCr/Pi, PME/PDE, PME/PCr, and PDE/ATP were investigated. In PD, energy and membrane metabolism in CE tumor areas have a tendency to "normalize" under therapy. In different "normal-appearing" brain areas of GB patients, the energy and membrane metabolism either "normalized" or were "disturbed", in comparison to baseline or controls. Differences were also detected between patients with SD and PD. 31P-MRS might contribute as an additional imaging biomarker for outcome measurement, which remains to be investigated in a larger cohort.

Title: Distinguishing Tumor Recurrence From Radiation Necrosis in Treated Glioblastoma Using Multiparametric MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of single-parameter, unimodal and bimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differentiating tumor recurrence (TR) from radiation necrosis (RN) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) after treatment using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement-perfusion weighted imaging (DSC-PWI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically proven GBM who underwent surgical intervention followed by chemoradiotherapy and developed a new, progressively enhanced lesion on follow-up MRI were included in our study. Subsequently, DWI, DTI, DSC-PWI, and (1)H-MRS were performed. Then, these patients underwent a second surgical operation or follow-up MRI to prove TR or RN. MRI metrics include apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative ADC (rADC) values derived from DWI; fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusion coefficient (DA) and radial diffusion coefficient (DR) values derived from DTI; and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) derived from DSC-PWI. Spectral metabolites such as choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), lactate (Lac), and lipids (Lip) were derived from MRS, and the ratios of these metabolites were calculated, including Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr, NAA/Cr, Lac/Cr, and Lip/Cr. These indices were compared between the TR group and RN group, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance in distinguishing TR from RN by using single-parameter, unimodal and bimodal MRI. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the TR and RN groups in terms of ADC (p = 0.001), rADC (p < 0.001), FA (p = 0.001), DA (p = 0.003), DR (p = 0.003), rCBV (p < 0.001), rCBF (p < 0.001), Cho/NAA (p < 0.001), Lac/Cr (p < 0.001) and Lip/Cr (p < 0.001). ROC analysis suggested that rCBV, MRS, and DSC + MRS were the optimal single-parameter, unimodal, and bimodal MRI classifiers for distinguishing TR from RN, with AUC values of 0.909, 0.940, and 0.994, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of parameters based on multiparametric MRI in the region of enhanced lesions is a valuable noninvasive tool for discriminating TR from RN.

Title: Effects of the Combined Treatment with a G-Quadruplex-Stabilizing Ligand and Photon Beams on Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells: A Magnetic Resonance Study.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis and high rates of chemo-radiotherapy failure, mainly due to a small cell fraction with stem-like properties (GSCs). The mechanisms underlying GSC response to radiation need to be elucidated to enhance sensitivity to treatments and to develop new therapeutic strategies. In a previous study, two GSC lines, named line #1 and line #83, responded differently to carbon ions and photon beams, with the differences likely attributable to their own different metabolic fingerprint rather than to radiation type. Data from the literature showed the capability of RHPS4, a G-quadruplex stabilizing ligand, to sensitize the glioblastoma radioresistant U251MG cells to X-rays. The combined metabolic effect of ligand #190, a new RHPS4-derivative showing reduced cardiotoxicity, and a photon beam has been monitored by magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy for the two GSC lines, #1 and #83, to reveal whether a synergistic response occurs. MR spectra from both lines were affected by single and combined treatments, but the variations of the analysed metabolites were statistically significant mainly in line #1, without synergistic effects due to combination. The multivariate analysis of ten metabolites shows a separation between control and treated samples in line #1 regardless of treatment type, while separation was not detected in line #83.

Title: Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Pediatric Glioblastomas.
Abstract: The shortly upcoming 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System is bringing extensive changes in the terminology of diffuse high-grade gliomas (DHGGs). Previously "glioblastoma," as a descriptive entity, could have been applied to classify some tumors from the family of pediatric or adult DHGGs. However, now the term "glioblastoma" has been divested and is no longer applied to tumors in the family of pediatric types of DHGGs. As an entity, glioblastoma remains, however, in the family of adult types of diffuse gliomas under the insignia of "glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype." Of note, glioblastomas still can be detected in children when glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is found in this population, despite being much more common in adults. Despite the separation from the family of pediatric types of DHGGs, what was previously labeled as "pediatric glioblastomas" still remains with novel labels and as new entities. As a result of advances in molecular biology, most of the previously called "pediatric glioblastomas" are now classified in one of the four family members of pediatric types of DHGGs. In this review, the term glioblastoma is still apocryphally employed mainly due to its historical relevance and the paucity of recent literature dealing with the recently described new entities. Therefore, "glioblastoma" is used here as an umbrella term in the attempt to encompass multiple entities such as astrocytoma, IDH-mutant (grade 4); glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype; diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant; diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype; and high grade infant-type hemispheric glioma. Glioblastomas are highly aggressive neoplasms. They may arise anywhere in the developing central nervous system, including the spinal cord. Signs and symptoms are non-specific, typically of short duration, and usually derived from increased intracranial pressure or seizure. Localized symptoms may also occur. The standard of care of "pediatric glioblastomas" is not well-established, typically composed of surgery with maximal safe tumor resection. Subsequent chemoradiation is recommended if the patient is older than 3 years. If younger than 3 years, surgery is followed by chemotherapy. In general, "pediatric glioblastomas" also have a poor prognosis despite surgery and adjuvant therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of glioblastomas. In addition to the typical conventional MRI features, i.e., highly heterogeneous invasive masses with indistinct borders, mass effect on surrounding structures, and a variable degree of enhancement, the lesions may show restricted diffusion in the solid components, hemorrhage, and increased perfusion, reflecting increased vascularity and angiogenesis. In addition, magnetic resonance spectroscopy has proven helpful in pre- and postsurgical evaluation. Lastly, we will refer to new MRI techniques, which have already been applied in evaluating adult glioblastomas, with promising results, yet not widely utilized in children.

Title: Detection of 2-Hydroxyglutarate by 3.0-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Gliomas with Rare IDH Mutations: Making Sense of "False-Positive" Cases.
Abstract: We have previously published a study on the reliable detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in lower-grade gliomas by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In this short article, we re-evaluated five glioma cases originally assessed as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype, which showed a high accumulation of 2HG, and were thought to be false-positives. A new primer was used for the detection of IDH2 mutation by Sanger sequencing. Adequate tissue for DNA analysis was available in 4 out of 5 cases. We found rare IDH2 mutations in two cases, with IDH2 R172W mutation in one case and IDH2 R172K mutation in another case. Both cases had very small mutant peaks, suggesting that the tumor volume was low in the tumor samples. Thus, the specificity of MRS for detecting IDH1/2 mutations was higher (81.3%) than that originally reported (72.2%). The detection of 2HG by MRS can aid in the diagnosis of rare, non-IDH1-R132H IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in gliomas.

Title: Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Distinguish Primary Central Nervous System Vasculitis from Glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) from glioblastoma to facilitate the development of an appropriate treatment for PCNSV. METHODS: We enrolled patients who were treated for PCNSV or glioblastoma at our center between January 2007 and August 2018. We compared the diagnoses of the 2 conditions by retrospectively reviewing patients' data for contrast-enhanced MRI, perfusion MRI, flow-sensitive black-blood (FSBB) imaging, and (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). RESULTS: We evaluated 108 patients (6 PCNSV; 102 glioblastoma). We found a statistically significant correlation between diagnosis and the contrast pattern on MRI. Perivascular enhancement was observed in all cases of PCNSV as follows: ring-like, homogeneous, and irregular patterns were observed in 53 (60%), 18 (20%), and 17 (19%) cases of glioblastoma, respectively. We identified a statistically significant correlation between diagnosis and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in 3 patients with PCNSV who underwent perfusion MRI; and all had low CBVs. Among the 55 patients with glioblastoma who underwent perfusion MRI, low and high CBVs were detected in 3 and 52 patients, respectively. There was no significant correlation between diagnosis and FSBB findings. Evaluation of (1)H-MRS data showed statistically significant differences between PCNSV and glioblastoma as functions of neuronal amino acid levels on long echo time MRS, with a slightly different amino acid profile, including glutamine + glutamate on short echo time MRS. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced MRI, perfusion MRI, and quantitative analysis of (1)H-MRS are valuable techniques for distinguishing PCNSV from glioblastoma before surgery.

Title: Diagnosis and analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma based on MRI segmentation algorithm.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This paper summarizes the MRI imaging findings of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) in the posterior cranial fossa to improve the accuracy of PCNSL diagnosis in the posterior cranial fossa. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the MRI imaging manifestations of 15 PCNSL posterior cranial fossa cases confirmed by puncture or surgical pathology from June 2017 to May 2018, including their occurrence sites, the number of lesions, MRI plain and enhanced manifestations, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Imaging (MRS) performance. RESULTS: A total of 15 cases were enrolled, including 10 cases of single lesion and five cases of multiple lesions. The total number of lesions was 25, which were in the cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellar vermis, midbrain, fourth ventricle, and pontine cerebellum. The lesions were round, irregular, nodular, patchy, with low or medium signals on T1WI, equal or slightly higher signals on T2WI, and enhanced with 25 meningiomas-like gray matter signals. All of them were significantly strengthened. "Acupoint sign" and "umbilical depression sign" were seen in eight lesions. There were 17 massive and nodular enhancements, four striped enhancements, three patchy enhancements, and one circular enhancement. five cases of DWI showed homogeneous high signal, two cases showed uneven high signal, and 3 cases showed medium signal. The ADC value of tumor parenchyma in 10 patients was (0.62+/-0.095)x10(-3)mm(2)/s. MRS examination showed obvious Lip peak in two cases. CONCLUSION: PCNSL in posterior cranial fossa has certain characteristics. DWI, ADC value and MRS are helpful to improve the correct diagnosis rate of PCNSL.

Title: Congress of Neurological Surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update on the role of imaging in the management of progressive glioblastoma in adults.
Abstract: TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with glioblastoma who have been previously treated with first-line radiation or chemoradiotherapy and who are suspected of experiencing tumor progression. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, is standard contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion weighted imaging useful for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes? LEVEL II: Magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement including diffusion weighted imaging is recommended as the imaging surveillance method to detect the progression of previously diagnosed glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does magnetic resonance spectroscopy add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL II: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is recommended as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does magnetic resonance perfusion add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: Magnetic resonance perfusion is suggested as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does the addition of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide additional useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging is suggested as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: The routine use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to identify progression of glioblastoma is not recommended. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does positron emission tomography with amino acid agents add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: It is suggested that amino acid positron emission tomography be considered to assist in the differentiation of progressive glioblastoma from treatment related changes.

Title: Preliminary study of multiple b-value diffusion-weighted images and T1 post enhancement magnetic resonance imaging images fusion with Laplacian Re-decomposition (LRD) medical fusion algorithm for glioma grading.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Grade of brain tumor is thought to be the most significant and crucial component in treatment management. Recent development in medical imaging techniques have led to the introduce non-invasive methods for brain tumor grading such as different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols. Combination of different MRI protocols with fusion algorithms for tumor grading is used to increase diagnostic improvement. This paper investigated the efficiency of the Laplacian Re-decomposition (LRD) fusion algorithms for glioma grading. PROCEDURES: In this study, 69 patients were examined with MRI. The T1 post enhancement (T1Gd) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were obtained. To evaluated LRD performance for glioma grading, we compared the parameters of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. FINDINGS: We found that the average Relative Signal Contrast (RSC) for high-grade gliomas is greater than RSCs for low-grade gliomas in T1Gd images and all fused images. No significant difference in RSCs of DWI images was observed between low-grade and high-grade gliomas. However, a significant RSCs difference was detected between grade III and IV in the T1Gd, b50, and all fussed images. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that T1Gd images are an appropriate imaging protocol for separating low-grade and high-grade gliomas. According to the findings of this study, we may use the LRD fusion algorithm to increase the diagnostic value of T1Gd and DWI picture for grades III and IV glioma distinction. In conclusion, this article has emphasized the significance of the LRD fusion algorithm as a tool for differentiating grade III and IV gliomas.

Title: Bioguided isolation of a selective compound from Calea phyllolepis leaves against breast cancer cells.
Abstract: Plants of the Calea genus have been reported to contain lipophilic compounds, such as sesquiterpene lactones, with cytotoxic effect against different cancer cell lines. The aim of this manuscript was to investigate the chemical profile and cytotoxic activity of different fractions from Calea phylolepis leaves on different human cancer cell lines. The fractions were prepared using solvent extraction of increasing polarity, yielding hexane, ethyl acetate and methanolic fractions. All fractions were chemically analysed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and their cytotoxic activity against HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), U-251MG (malignant glioblastoma) and L929 (mouse fibroblast) cell lines was investigated. Among these, the hexane and ethyl acetate fractions showed higher cytotoxic effects, while the methanolic fraction did not show any cytotoxic effects. The major bioactive compound from the hexane fraction (12.15%) was isolated using chromatographic methods and was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis as 6-epi-beta-verbesinol coumarate. This compound showed activity against breast cancer cells (IC(50)  = 5.8 +/- 1.0 mug/ml), similar to etoposide. Furthermore, 6-epi-beta-verbesinol coumarate showed low cytotoxicity to normal fibroblast cells, suggesting a high selectivity index (SI = 7.39) against breast cancer cells.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy - its added value in brain glioma multiparametric assessment.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analysed the results of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the patients with gliomas, including the error rate, MRS parameters variability, correlations with gene mutations and overall usefulness for clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty patients with glial tumours were examined by multiparametric MRI completed with single voxel MRS, as one group, then as two separate groups according to progression of the disease after the initial surgery. The error rate between the groups, MRS parameters variability, hazard ratios and correlations between metabolites, genetic markers and tumour grade were all analysed. RESULTS: Variability in Cho/Cr(h) was significantly higher in the group with a disease progression (p = 0.044). In the patients with a stable disease, strong significant negative correlations between Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA with p53 mutation (-0.945 and -0.812 respectively, p < 0.05) and between Cho/Cr and IDH1, 2 mutation (-0.796, p < 0.05) were found. In the patients with tumour progression, a significant positive correlation of NAA/Cr with 1p19q codeletion (0.486, p < 0.05) and of Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA values with p53 mutation (0.477 and 0.416, p < 0.05) were identified. Tumour grade positively correlated with Cho/Cr values (0.304, p = 0.02) in the whole patient group. CONCLUSION: MRS brings an added value to multiparametric MRI evaluation of brain tumours in the patient follow-up after an initial surgery, especially in ambiguous findings (Tab. 5, Fig. 2, Ref. 29).

Title: Lymphomatosis cerebri: Multimodality imaging features and misdiagnosis analysis.
Abstract: Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) is a significant challenge in terms of its clinical diagnosis due to it being a rare disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the multimodality imaging characteristics, clinical features and reasons for misdiagnosis of LC with the goal of potentially facilitating early and accurate diagnosis of this frequently misdiagnosed disease. In the present study, clinical data and cerebral multimodality imaging findings from 11 patients with LC proven based on pathology were retrospectively analyzed and reviewed with consultation of the literature. The results indicated that the common symptoms included cognitive decline (8/11), gait disturbance (9/11) and behavioral abnormalities (5/11). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated that the number of cells and level of protein increased (8/10). All patients had both deep and lobar lesion distribution of bilateral cerebral white matter with equal or slightly low-density shadows on CT plain scan and slightly longer signals on T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Most of the lesions (9/11) exhibited isointensity or slight hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. In addition, five patients presented with a marked decrease in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (Cr) and increase in choline/Cr on (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including an increase in lipid/Cr in 3 cases. Of these, one case exhibited no increase in lesion metabolism and 2 cases had slightly increased uptake on positron emission tomography/CT. The present study indicated that the multimodality imaging findings of LC have certain distinct characteristics and prompt recognition of these features may significantly improve early diagnosis and patient prognosis. Misdiagnosis may be mainly due to insufficient understanding knowledge of the condition and improper brain biopsy.

Title: Dysregulated Alanine as a Potential Predictive Marker of Glioma-An Insight from Untargeted HRMAS-NMR and Machine Learning Data.
Abstract: Metabolic alterations play a crucial role in glioma development and progression and can be detected even before the appearance of the fatal phenotype. We have compared the circulating metabolic fingerprints of glioma patients versus healthy controls, for the first time, in a quest to identify a panel of small, dysregulated metabolites with potential to serve as a predictive and/or diagnostic marker in the clinical settings. High-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HRMAS-NMR) was used for untargeted metabolomics and data acquisition followed by a machine learning (ML) approach for the analyses of large metabolic datasets. Cross-validation of ML predicted NMR spectral features was done by statistical methods (Wilcoxon-test) using JMP-pro16 software. Alanine was identified as the most critical metabolite with potential to detect glioma with precision of 1.0, recall of 0.96, and F1 measure of 0.98. The top 10 metabolites identified for glioma detection included alanine, glutamine, valine, methionine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serine, alpha-glucose, lactate, and arginine. We achieved 100% accuracy for the detection of glioma using ML algorithms, extra tree classifier, and random forest, and 98% accuracy with logistic regression. Classification of glioma in low and high grades was done with 86% accuracy using logistic regression model, and with 83% and 79% accuracy using extra tree classifier and random forest, respectively. The predictive accuracy of our ML model is superior to any of the previously reported algorithms, used in tissue- or liquid biopsy-based metabolic studies. The identified top metabolites can be targeted to develop early diagnostic methods as well as to plan personalized treatment strategies.

Title: Role of MRI in Differentiating Various Posterior Cranial Fossa Space-Occupying Lesions Using Sensitivity and Specificity: A Prospective Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Any abnormal space-occupying posterior fossa lesion may directly involve the vital structures like the brain stem, cranial nerves, cerebellum, vertebrobasilar artery, and venous sinuses, which makes the surgical approach and total excision very difficult. Hence for these reasons, precise evaluation of posterior fossa lesion with MRI is a must to visualize the vital structures, which helps in planning and safe surgery.  Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the localization, extension, characterization, differentiation of various posterior fossa space-occupying lesions, and correlating with the histopathological result. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study comprised of 40 patients who were suspected with posterior fossa space-occupying lesions on basis of clinical features or on CT scan. All patients were evaluated using conventional as well as newer MRI techniques using Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Medical System, Erlangen, Germany). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was done in all patients and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was done in 27 patients. Based on the MRI findings, various posterior fossa lesions were classified as neoplastic or non-neoplastic. The neoplastic lesions were further classified as benign and malignant. The MRI findings were correlated with histopathological findings or follow-up. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Independent sample t-test was used to compare the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of various posterior fossa space-occupying lesions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to determine the optimal cut-off mean ADC values and choline/creatinine (Cho/cr) ratios for various benign and malignant posterior fossa tumors. RESULTS: Of 40 patients with posterior fossa lesions, 23 were males and 17 were females with a mean age of 34.67+/-1.93[SD] years. Metastases were the most common posterior fossa lesions in our study sample and found in seven patients (17.5%) followed by vestibular schwannomas and brainstem gliomas in five patients (12.5%) each, demyelinating lesion in four patients (10%), tubercular abscess in three patients (7.5%), hemangioblastoma, tuberculoma, arachnoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, pilocytic astrocytoma, low-grade glioma in two patients (5%) each, meningioma, medulloblastoma, pyogenic abscess and high-grade glioma in one patient (2.5%) each. The mean ADC value of benign tumors was higher than that of malignant tumors and this difference was found to be significant (p = 0.019). The cut-off ADC value 1.022 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s had a sensitivity of 78.6% and specificity of 66.7%. MRS played important role in differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions and benign from malignant tumors. The cut-off Cho/cr ratio of 1.25 had a sensitivity of 66.7%, specificity of 85.7% to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. CONCLUSION: Conventional MRI sequences able to diagnose most of the benign-appearing lesions of posterior fossa, however, adding advanced MRI sequences like diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy helps us to differentiate and diagnose various posterior fossa lesions even closer to the actual histopathological diagnosis.

Title: Metabolic and transcriptomic profiles of glioblastoma invasion revealed by comparisons between patients and corresponding orthotopic xenografts in mice.
Abstract: The invasive behavior of glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, is considered highly relevant for tumor recurrence. However, the invasion zone is difficult to visualize by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and is protected by the blood brain barrier, posing a particular challenge for treatment. We report biological features of invasive growth accompanying tumor progression and invasion based on associated metabolic and transcriptomic changes observed in patient derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) in the mouse and the corresponding patients' tumors. The evolution of metabolic changes, followed in vivo longitudinally by (1)H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) at ultra-high field, reflected growth and the invasive properties of the human glioblastoma transplanted into the brains of mice (PDOX). Comparison of MRS derived metabolite signatures, reflecting temporal changes of tumor development and invasion in PDOX, revealed high similarity to spatial metabolite signatures of combined multi-voxel MRS analyses sampled across different areas of the patients' tumors. Pathway analyses of the transcriptome associated with the metabolite profiles of the PDOX, identified molecular signatures of invasion, comprising extracellular matrix degradation and reorganization, growth factor binding, and vascular remodeling. Specific analysis of expression signatures from the invaded mouse brain, revealed extent of invasion dependent induction of immune response, recapitulating respective signatures observed in glioblastoma. Integrating metabolic profiles and gene expression of highly invasive PDOX provided insights into progression and invasion associated mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling that is essential for cell-cell communication and regulation of cellular processes. Structural changes and biochemical properties of the extracellular matrix are of importance for the biological behavior of tumors and may be druggable. Ultra-high field MRS reveals to be suitable for in vivo monitoring of progression in the non-enhancing infiltration zone of glioblastoma.

Title: Phosphorous Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Molecular Markers in IDH1 Wild Type Glioblastoma.
Abstract: The World Health Organisation's (WHO) classification of brain tumors requires consideration of both histological appearance and molecular characteristics. Possible differences in brain energy metabolism could be important in designing future therapeutic strategies. Forty-three patients with primary, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) wild type glioblastomas (GBMs) were included in this study. Pre-operative standard MRI was obtained with additional phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31-P-MRS) imaging. Following microsurgical resection of the tumors, biopsy specimens underwent neuropathological diagnostics including standard molecular diagnosis. The spectroscopy results were correlated with epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status. EGFR amplified tumors had significantly lower phosphocreatine (PCr) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-PCr/ATP and PCr to inorganic phosphate (Pi)-PCr/Pi ratios, and higher Pi/ATP and phosphomonoesters (PME) to phosphodiesters (PDE)-PME/PDE ratio than those without the amplification. Patients with MGMT-methylated tumors had significantly higher cerebral magnesium (Mg) values and PME/PDE ratio, while their PCr/ATP and PCr/Pi ratios were lower than in patients without the methylation. In survival analysis, not-EGFR-amplified, MGMT-methylated GBMs showed the longest survival. This group had lower PCr/Pi ratio when compared to MGMT-methylated, EGFR-amplified group. PCr/Pi ratio was lower also when compared to the MGMT-unmethylated, EGFR not-amplified group, while PCr/ATP ratio was lower than all other examined groups. Differences in energy metabolism in various molecular subtypes of wild-type-GBMs could be important information in future precision medicine approach.

Title: Feasibility and Biological Activity of a Ketogenic/Intermittent-Fasting Diet in Patients With Glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, safety, systemic biological activity, and cerebral activity of a ketogenic dietary intervention in patients with glioma. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with biopsy-confirmed World Health Organization grade 2 to 4 astrocytoma with stable disease after adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in an 8-week Glioma Atkins-Based Diet (GLAD). GLAD consisted of 2 fasting days (calories <20% calculated estimated needs) interleaved between 5 modified Atkins diet days (net carbohydrates </=20 g/d) each week. The primary outcome was dietary adherence by food records. Markers of systemic and cerebral activity included weekly urine ketones, serum insulin, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, insulin-like growth factor-1, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and week 8. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (84%) completed the study. Eighty percent of patients reached >/=40 mg/dL urine acetoacetate during the study. Forty-eight percent of patients were adherent by food record. The diet was well tolerated, with two grade 3 adverse events (neutropenia, seizure). Measures of systemic activity, including hemoglobin A1c, insulin, and fat body mass, decreased significantly, while lean body mass increased. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated increased ketone concentrations (beta-hydroxybutyrate [bHB] and acetone) in both lesional and contralateral brain compared to baseline. Average ketonuria correlated with cerebral ketones in lesional (tumor) and contralateral brain (bHB R (s) = 0.52, p = 0.05). Subgroup analysis of isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant glioma showed no differences in cerebral metabolites after controlling for ketonuria. CONCLUSION: The GLAD dietary intervention, while demanding, produced meaningful ketonuria and significant systemic and cerebral metabolic changes in participants. Ketonuria in participants correlated with cerebral ketone concentration and appears to be a better indicator of systemic activity than patient-reported food records.

Title: Imaging biomarkers for evaluating tumor response: RECIST and beyond.
Abstract: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is the gold standard for assessment of treatment response in solid tumors. Morphologic change of tumor size evaluated by RECIST is often correlated with survival length and has been considered as a surrogate endpoint of therapeutic efficacy. However, the detection of morphologic change alone may not be sufficient for assessing response to new anti-cancer medication in all solid tumors. During the past fifteen years, several molecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapies have emerged in cancer treatment which work by disrupting signaling pathways and inhibited cell growth. Tumor necrosis or lack of tumor progression is associated with a good therapeutic response even in the absence of tumor shrinkage. Therefore, the use of unmodified RECIST criteria to estimate morphological changes of tumor alone may not be sufficient to estimate tumor response for these new anti-cancer drugs. Several studies have reported the low reliability of RECIST in evaluating treatment response in different tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, prostate cancer, brain glioma, bone metastasis, and lymphoma. There is an increased need for new medical imaging biomarkers, considering the changes in tumor viability, metabolic activity, and attenuation, which are related to early tumor response. Promising imaging techniques, beyond RECIST, include dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weight imaging (DWI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). This review outlines the current RECIST with their limitations and the new emerging concepts of imaging biomarkers in oncology.

Title: Utility of 3T single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy for differentiating intracranial meningiomas from intracranial enhanced mass lesions.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides structural and metabolic information that is useful for the diagnosis of meningiomas with atypical radiological appearance. However, the metabolite that should be prioritized for the diagnosis of meningiomas has not been established. PURPOSE: To evaluate the differences between the metabolic peaks of meningiomas and other intracranial enhanced mass lesions (non-meningiomas) using MR spectroscopy in short echo time (TE) spectra and the most useful metabolic peak for discriminating between the groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 9 meningiomas, 22 non-meningiomas, intracranial enhancing tumors and abscesses, and 15 normal controls. The ranking of the peak at 3.8 ppm, peak at 3.8 ppm/Creatine (Cr), beta-gamma Glutamine-Glutamate (bgGlx)/Cr, N-acetyl compounds (NACs)/Cr, choline (Cho)/Cr, lipid and/or lactate (Lip-Lac) at 1.3 ppm/Cr, and the presence of alanine (Ala) were derived. The metabolic peaks were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. ROC analysis was used to determine the cut-off values for differentiating meningiomas from non-meningiomas using statistically significant metabolic peaks. RESULTS: The ranking of the peak at 3.8 ppm among all the peaks, peak at 3.8 ppm/Cr, bgGlx/Cr, Lip-Lac/Cr, and the presence of Ala discriminated meningiomas from non-meningiomas with moderate to high accuracy. The highest accuracy was 96.9% at a threshold value of 3 for the rank of the peak at 3.8 ppm. CONCLUSION: A distinct elevated peak at 3.8 ppm, ranked among the top three highest peaks, allowed the detection of meningiomas.

Title: ChoK-Full of Potential: Choline Kinase in B Cell and T Cell Malignancies.
Abstract: Aberrant choline metabolism, characterized by an increase in total choline-containing compounds, phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine (PC), is a metabolic hallmark of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. This aberration arises from alterations in metabolic enzymes that control PC biosynthesis and catabolism. Among these enzymes, choline kinase alpha (CHKalpha) exhibits the most frequent alterations and is commonly overexpressed in human cancers. CHKalpha catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to generate phosphocholine, the first step in de novo PC biosynthesis. CHKalpha overexpression is associated with the malignant phenotype, metastatic capability and drug resistance in human cancers, and thus has been recognized as a robust biomarker and therapeutic target of cancer. Of clinical importance, increased choline metabolism and CHKalpha activity can be detected by non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with radiolabeled choline analogs for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of cancer patients. Both choline-based MRS and PET/CT imaging have also been clinically applied for lymphoid malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and central nervous system lymphoma. However, information on how choline kinase is dysregulated in lymphoid malignancies is very limited and has just begun to be unraveled. In this review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of choline kinase in B cell and T cell malignancies with the goal of promoting future investigation in this area.

Title: Differentiating Glioblastomas from Solitary Brain Metastases: An Update on the Current Literature of Advanced Imaging Modalities.
Abstract: Differentiating between glioblastomas and solitary brain metastases proves to be a challenging diagnosis for neuroradiologists, as both present with imaging patterns consisting of peritumoral hyperintensities with similar intratumoral texture on traditional magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Early diagnosis is paramount, as each pathology has completely different methods of clinical assessment. In the past decade, recent developments in advanced imaging modalities enabled providers to acquire a more accurate diagnosis earlier in the patient's clinical assessment, thus optimizing clinical outcome. Dynamic susceptibility contrast has been optimized for detecting relative cerebral blood flow and relative cerebral blood volume. Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to detect changes in mean diffusivity. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging is an innovative modality detecting changes in intracellular volume fraction, isotropic volume fraction, and extracellular volume fraction. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is able to assist by providing a metabolic descriptor while detecting variable ratios of choline/N-acetylaspartate, choline/creatine, and N-acetylaspartate/creatine. Finally, radiomics and machine learning algorithms have been devised to assist in improving diagnostic accuracy while often utilizing more than one advanced imaging protocol per patient. In this review, we provide an update on all the current evidence regarding the identification and differentiation of glioblastomas from solitary brain metastases.

Title: Joint application of biochemical markers and imaging techniques in the accurate and early detection of glioblastoma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor with the most metastatic effect in adults. Despite the wide range of multidimensional treatments, tumor heterogeneity is one of the main causes of tumor spread and gives great complexity to diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Therefore, featuring noble noninvasive prognostic methods that are focused on glioblastoma heterogeneity is perceived as an urgent need. Imaging neuro-oncological biomarkers including MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promoter methylation status, tumor grade along with other tumor characteristics and demographic features (e.g., age) are commonly referred to during diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic processes. Therefore, the use of new noninvasive prognostic methods focused on glioblastoma heterogeneity is considered an urgent need. Some neuronal biomarkers, including the promoter methylation status of the promoter MGMT, the characteristics and grade of the tumor, along with the patient's demographics (such as age and sex) are involved in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Among the wide array of imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging combined with the more physiologically detailed technique of H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be useful in diagnosing neurological cancer patients. In addition, intracranial tumor qualitative analysis and sometimes tumor biopsies help in accurate diagnosis. This review summarizes the evidence for biochemical biomarkers being a reliable biomarker in the early detection and disease management in GBM. Moreover, we highlight the correlation between Imaging techniques and biochemical biomarkers and ask whether they can be combined.

Title: Prediction of Glioma Stemlike Cell Infiltration in the Non-Contrast-Enhancing Area by Quantitative Measurement of Lactate on Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We previously reported that glioma stemlike cells (GSCs) exist in the area of the tumor periphery showing no gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. In the present work, we analyzed glucose metabolism to investigate whether lactate could be predictive of tumor invasiveness and of use in detection of the tumor invasion area in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). METHODS: The expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) was investigated in 20 patients. In GSC lines, LDH-A and PDH expression also was examined in parallel to assessments of mitochondrial respiration. We then investigated the relationship between lactate/creatine ratios in the tumor periphery measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, using learning-compression-model algorithms and phenotypes of GBMs. RESULTS: In 20 GBMs, high-invasive GBM expressed LDH-A at significantly higher expression than did low-invasive GBM, whereas low-invasive GBM showed significantly higher expression of PDH than did high-invasive GBM. The highly invasive GSC line showed higher expression of LDH-A and lower expression of PDH compared with low-invasive GSC lines. The highly invasive GSC line also showed the lowest consumption of oxygen and the lowest production of adenosine triphosphate. Lactate levels, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, showed a significant positive correlation with LDH-A transcript levels, permitting classification of the GBMs into high-invasive and low-invasive phenotypes based on a cutoff value of 0.66 in the lactate/creatine ratio. CONCLUSIONS: In the tumor periphery area of the highly invasive GBM, aerobic glycolysis was the predominant pathway for glucose metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of lactate. The level of lactate may facilitate prediction of the tumor-infiltrating area on GBM.

Title: Myoinositol to Total Choline Ratio in Glioblastomas as a Potential Prognostic Factor in Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type diffuse astrocytic tumors tend to be pathologically diagnosed as glioblastomas (GBMs). We previously reported that myoinositol to total choline (Ins/Cho) ratio in GBMs on magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was significantly lower than that in IDH-mutant gliomas. We then hypothesized that a low Ins/Cho ratio is a poor prognosis factor in patients with GBMs, IDH-wild-type. In the present study, we calculated the Ins/Cho ratios of patients with GBMs and investigated their progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to determine their utility as prognostic marker. We classified patients with GBMs harboring wild-type IDH (n = 27) into two groups based on the Ins/Cho ratio, and compared patient backgrounds, pathological findings, PFS, OS, and copy number aberrations between the high and low Ins/Cho groups. Patients with GBMs in the low Ins/Cho ratio group indicated shorter PFS (P = 0.021) and OS (P = 0.048) than those in the high Ins/Cho group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the Ins/Cho ratio was significantly correlated with PFS (hazard ratio 0.24, P = 0.028). In conclusion, the preoperative Ins/Cho ratio can be used as a novel potential prognostic factor for GBM, IDH-wild-type.

Title: Phosphorous Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to Detect Regional Differences of Energy and Membrane Metabolism in Naive Glioblastoma Multiforme.
Abstract: Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant primary brain tumor with infiltration of, on conventional imaging, normal-appearing brain parenchyma. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) enables the investigation of different energy and membrane metabolites. The aim of this study is to investigate regional differences of 31P-metabolites in GBM brains. Methods: In this study, we investigated 32 patients (13 female and 19 male; mean age 63 years) with naive GBM using 31P-MRS and conventional MRI. Contrast-enhancing (CE), T2-hyperintense, adjacent and distant ipsilateral areas of the contralateral brain and the brains of age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were assessed. Moreover, the 31P-MRS results were correlated with quantitative diffusion parameters. Results: Several metabolite ratios between the energy-dependent metabolites and/or the membrane metabolites differed significantly between the CE areas, the T2-hyperintense areas, the more distant areas, and even the brains of healthy volunteers. pH values and Mg(2+) concentrations were highest in visible tumor areas and decreased with distance from them. These results are in accordance with the literature and correlated with quantitative diffusion parameters. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that 31P-MRS is feasible to show regional differences of energy and membrane metabolism in brains with naive GBM, particularly between the different "normal-appearing" regions and between the contralateral hemisphere and healthy controls. Differences between various genetic mutations or clinical applicability for follow-up monitoring have to be assessed in a larger cohort.

Title: A Phase Ib Clinical Trial of Metformin and Chloroquine in Patients with IDH1-Mutated Solid Tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) occur in 60% of chondrosarcoma, 80% of WHO grade II-IV glioma and 20% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. These solid IDH1-mutated tumors produce the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) and are more vulnerable to disruption of their metabolism. METHODS: Patients with IDH1-mutated chondrosarcoma, glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma received oral combinational treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin and the antimalarial drug chloroquine. The primary objective was to determine the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Radiological and biochemical tumor responses to metformin and chloroquine were investigated using CT/MRI scans and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements of D-2HG levels in serum. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received study treatment for a median duration of 43 days (range: 7-74 days). Of twelve evaluable patients, 10 patients discontinued study medication because of progressive disease and two patients due to toxicity. None of the patients experienced a DLT. The MTD was determined to be 1500 mg of metformin two times a day and 200 mg of chloroquine once a day. A serum D/L-2HG ratio of >/=4.5 predicted the presence of an IDH1 mutation with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. By utilization of digital droplet PCR on plasma samples, we were able to detect tumor-specific IDH1 hotspot mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in investigated patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment of advanced IDH1-mutated solid tumors with metformin and chloroquine was well tolerated but did not induce a clinical response in this phase Ib clinical trial.

Title: Mapping of Metabolic Heterogeneity of Glioma Using MR-Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) delivers information about the non-invasive metabolic landscape of brain pathologies. (1)H-MRS is used in clinical setting in addition to MRI for diagnostic, prognostic and treatment response assessments, but the use of this radiological tool is not entirely widespread. The importance of developing automated analysis tools for (1)H-MRS lies in the possibility of a straightforward application and simplified interpretation of metabolic and genetic data that allow for incorporation into the daily practice of a broad audience. Here, we report a prospective clinical imaging trial (DRKS00019855) which aimed to develop a novel MR-spectroscopy-based algorithm for in-depth characterization of brain lesions and prediction of molecular traits. Dimensional reduction of metabolic profiles demonstrated distinct patterns throughout pathologies. We combined a deep autoencoder and multi-layer linear discriminant models for voxel-wise prediction of the molecular profile based on MRS imaging. Molecular subtypes were predicted by an overall accuracy of 91.2% using a classifier score. Our study indicates a first step into combining the metabolic and molecular traits of lesions for advancing the pre-operative diagnostic workup of brain tumors and improve personalized tumor treatment.

Title: The utility of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in frame-less stereotactic needle biopsy of glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) can benefit the differentiation of gliomas preoperative grading and facilitate guiding biopsy. This study was to investigate the optimal metabolite or metabolic ratios of MRS for the biopsy target delineating by using the technique of MRS imaging guided frame-less stereotactic biopsy. METHODS: During a 4 year period between the Sep 2012 and Oct 2016, 57 patients (25 women, 32 men; mean age, 46.4) with histologic diagnosis of glioma, who underwent the (1)H-MRS imaging guided frameless stereotactic biopsy, were retrospectively reviewed. The metabolite or metabolic ratios values of MRS was measured. And the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy as well as the area under the curve (AUC) of those parameters for glioma grading are calculated based on the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: 65 stereotactic biopsy samples from 57 patients were histopathologically clarified to HGGs (25) or LGGs (40) for quantitative analysis. The Cho, Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr values of LGGs group were significantly lower than that of HGGs (P = 0.09, 0.001, 0.003), and the NAA value of LGGs group was significantly higher than that of HGGs (P = 0.001). The cutoff value of 3.65 for the Cho/NAA ratio provided the best combination of sensitivity (92.0%), specificity (95.0%), and diagnostic accuracy (93.8%) for identifying glioma grade, which was superior to other parameters. CONCLUSION: The results of our study provided evidence that Cho/NAA ratio had the superior diagnostic performance in distinguishing glioma grade, indicating that the spot of highest Cho/NAA ratio was optimal metabolic targets for spectroscopic guided tissue sampling in homogenous glioma.

Title: 3D whole-brain metabolite imaging to improve characterization of low-to-intermediate grade gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: MRI is the standard imaging modality used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and post-treatment management of gliomas. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) MRI is used to plan biopsy and radiation for grade IV gliomas but is less effective for grade II and III gliomas (i.e., low-to-intermediate grade gliomas) which may have minimal or no enhancement. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is an advanced MRI technique that has been shown, to improve diagnostic yield of biopsy and target delineation for grade IV glioma. The purpose of this study is to determine if MRSI can improve characterization and tissue sampling of low-to-intermediate grade gliomas. METHODS: Prospective grade II and grade III glioma patients were enrolled to undergo whole brain high-resolution MRSI prior to tissue sampling. Choline/N-acetyl-aspartate (Cho/NAA) maps were overlaid on anatomic imaging and imported into stereotactic biopsy software. Patients were treated with standard-of-care surgery and radiation. Volumes of spectroscopically abnormal tissue were generated and compared with anatomic imaging and areas of enhancing recurrence on follow-up imaging. RESULTS: Ten patients had pathologic diagnosis of grade II (n = 4) or grade III (n = 6) with a median follow-up of 27.3 months. Five patients had recurrence, and regions of recurrence were found to overlap with metabolically abnormal regions on MRSI at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: MRSI in low-to-intermediate grade glioma patients is predictive of areas of subsequent recurrence. Larger studies are needed to determine if MRSI can be used to guide surgical and radiation treatment planning in these patients.

Title: Malignant pheochromocytoma with cerebral and skull metastasis: A case report and literature review.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Malignant pheochromocytoma with cerebral and skull metastasis is a very rare disease. Combining our case with 16 previously reported cases identified from a PubMed search, an analysis of 17 cases of malignant cerebral pheochromocytoma was conducted. This literature review aimed to provide information on clinical manifestations, radiographic and histopathological features, and treatment strategies of this condition. CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old man was admitted with a progressive headache and enlarging scalp mass lasting for 3 mo. Radiographic images revealed a left temporal biconvex-shaped epidural mass and multiple lytic lesions. The patient underwent a left temporal craniotomy for resection of the temporal tumor. Histopathological analysis led to identification of the mass as malignant pheochromocytoma. The patient's symptoms were alleviated at the postoperative 3-mo clinical follow-up. However, metastatic pheochromocytoma lesions were found on the right 6(th) rib and the 6(th) to 9(th) thoracic vertebrae on a 1-year clinical follow-up computed tomography scan. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and histopathological examination are necessary to make an accurate differential diagnosis between malignant cerebral pheochromocytoma and meningioma. Surgery is regarded as the first choice of treatment.

Title: Imaging 6-Phosphogluconolactonase Activity in Brain Tumors In Vivo Using Hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is essential for NADPH generation and redox homeostasis in cancer, including glioblastomas. However, the precise contribution to redox and tumor proliferation of the second PPP enzyme 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGLS), which converts 6-phospho-delta-gluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG), remains unclear. Furthermore, non-invasive methods of assessing PGLS activity are lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the role of PGLS in glioblastomas and assess the utility of probing PGLS activity using hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone for non-invasive imaging. METHODS: To interrogate the function of PGLS in redox, PGLS expression was silenced in U87, U251 and GS2 glioblastoma cells by RNA interference and levels of NADPH and reduced glutathione (GSH) measured. Clonogenicity assays were used to assess the effect of PGLS silencing on glioblastoma proliferation. Hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone metabolism to 6PG was assessed in live cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) or with vehicle control. (13)C 2D echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) studies of hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone metabolism were performed on rats bearing orthotopic glioblastoma tumors or tumor-free controls on a 3T spectrometer. Longitudinal 2D EPSI studies of hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone metabolism and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in rats bearing orthotopic U251 tumors following treatment with TMZ to examine the ability of hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone to report on treatment response. RESULTS: PGLS knockdown downregulated NADPH and GSH, elevated oxidative stress and inhibited clonogenicity in all models. Conversely, PGLS expression and activity and steady-state NADPH and GSH were higher in tumor tissues from rats bearing orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts relative to contralateral brain and tumor-free brain. Importantly, [1-(13)C]6PG production from hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone was observed in live glioblastoma cells and was significantly reduced by treatment with TMZ. Furthermore, hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone metabolism to [1-(13)C]6PG could differentiate tumor from contralateral normal brain in vivo. Notably, TMZ significantly reduced 6PG production from hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone at an early timepoint prior to volumetric alterations as assessed by anatomical imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we have, for the first time, identified a role for PGLS activity in glioblastoma proliferation and validated the utility of probing PGLS activity using hyperpolarized delta-[1-(13)C]gluconolactone for non-invasive in vivo imaging of glioblastomas and their response to therapy.

Title: Clinical Applications of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Brain Tumors: From Diagnosis to Treatment.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a valuable tool for imaging brain tumors, primarily as an adjunct to conventional imaging and clinical presentation. MRS is useful in initial diagnosis of brain tumors, helping differentiate tumors from possible mimics such as metastatic disease, lymphoma, demyelination, and infection, as well as in the subsequent follow-up of patients after resection and chemoradiation. Unfortunately, the spectroscopic appearance of many pathologies can overlap, and ultimately follow-up or biopsy may be required to make a definitive diagnosis. Future developments may continue to increase the value of MRS for initial diagnosis, treatment planning, and early detection of recurrence.

Title: The role of 2-hydroxyglutarate magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the determination of isocitrate dehydrogenase status in lower grade gliomas versus glioblastoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a non-invasive means of determining isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status. Determination of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) presence through MRS is a means of determining IDH status; however, differences may be seen by grade. The goal of this paper is to perform a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis on 2-HG MRS for IDH status in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) in preoperative patients. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines. Quality assessment was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2. The search was up to date as of 09/02/2021. Nine English-language journal articles were included. RESULTS: The meta-analysis found a pooled sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 58-99%) and specificity of 84% (95% CI 51-96%) for LGG (n= 181). For GBM (n= 77), the pooled sensitivity was 84% (95% CI 25.0-99%) and the specificity was 97% (95% CI 43-100%). CONCLUSION: 2-HG MRS shows promise as a non-invasive means of determining IDH status, with specificity higher for GBM and sensitivity higher for LGG. The wide confidence intervals are notable, however, in particular related to the small number of IDH-mutant GBM studied. Diagnostic heterogeneity was particularly present for LGG, and the hierarchical summary receiver operator curves showed poor predictive accuracy in both groups. For more conclusive results, diagnostic test accuracy statistics need to be quantified with larger studies and more deliberate study design.

Title: Implantable NMR Microcoils in Rats: A New Tool for Exploring Tumor Metabolism at Sub-Microliter Scale?
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a miniaturized implantable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) coil to acquire in vivo proton NMR spectra in sub-microliter regions of interest and to obtain metabolic information using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in these small volumes. For this purpose, the NMR microcoils were implanted in the right cortex of healthy rats and in C6 glioma-bearing rats. The dimensions of the microcoil were 450 micrometers wide and 3 mm long. The MRS acquisitions were performed at 7 Tesla using volume coil for RF excitation and microcoil for signal reception. The detection volume of the microcoil was measured equal to 450 nL. A gain in sensitivity equal to 76 was found in favor of implanted microcoil as compared to external surface coil. Nine resonances from metabolites were assigned in the spectra acquired in healthy rats (n = 5) and in glioma-bearing rat (n = 1). The differences in relative amplitude of choline, lactate and creatine resonances observed in glioma-bearing animal were in agreement with published findings on this tumor model. In conclusion, the designed implantable microcoil is suitable for in vivo MRS and can be used for probing the metabolism in localized and very small regions of interest in a tumor.

Title: Advanced Imaging Techniques for Radiotherapy Planning of Gliomas.
Abstract: The accuracy of target delineation in radiation treatment (RT) planning of cerebral gliomas is crucial to achieve high tumor control, while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, represents the current standard imaging modality for target volume delineation of gliomas. However, conventional sequences have limited capability to discriminate treatment-related changes from viable tumors, owing to the low specificity of increased blood-brain barrier permeability and peritumoral edema. Advanced physiology-based MRI techniques, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion MRI and perfusion MRI, have been developed for the biological characterization of gliomas and may circumvent these limitations, providing additional metabolic, structural, and hemodynamic information for treatment planning and monitoring. Radionuclide imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) with amino acid radiopharmaceuticals, are also increasingly used in the workup of primary brain tumors, and their integration in RT planning is being evaluated in specialized centers. This review focuses on the basic principles and clinical results of advanced MRI and PET imaging techniques that have promise as a complement to RT planning of gliomas.

Title: Monitoring tumor cell death in murine tumor models using deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging.
Abstract: (2)H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging has been shown recently to be a viable technique for metabolic imaging in the clinic. We show here that (2)H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging measurements of [2,3-(2)H(2)]malate production from [2,3-(2)H(2)]fumarate can be used to detect tumor cell death in vivo via the production of labeled malate. Production of [2,3-(2)H(2)]malate, following injection of [2,3-(2)H(2)]fumarate (1 g/kg) into tumor-bearing mice, was measured in a murine lymphoma (EL4) treated with etoposide, and in human breast (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal (Colo205) xenografts treated with a TRAILR2 agonist, using surface-coil localized (2)H MR spectroscopy at 7 T. Malate production was also imaged in EL4 tumors using a fast (2)H chemical shift imaging sequence. The malate/fumarate ratio increased from 0.016 +/- 0.02 to 0.16 +/- 0.14 in EL4 tumors 48 h after drug treatment (P = 0.0024, n = 3), and from 0.019 +/- 0.03 to 0.25 +/- 0.23 in MDA-MB-231 tumors (P = 0.0001, n = 5) and from 0.016 +/- 0.04 to 0.28 +/- 0.26 in Colo205 tumors (P = 0.0002, n = 5) 24 h after drug treatment. These increases were correlated with increased levels of cell death measured in excised tumor sections obtained immediately after imaging. (2)H MR measurements of [2,3-(2)H(2)]malate production from [2,3-(2)H(2)]fumarate provide a potentially less expensive and more sensitive method for detecting cell death in vivo than (13)C MR measurements of hyperpolarized [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate metabolism, which have been used previously for this purpose.

Title: Quantitative metabolic characteristics in the peritumoral region of gliomas at 7T.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The determination of tumor peripheral is of great significance in clinical diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to obtain the metabolic condition in tumor peripheral of gliomas in vivo at 7T. METHODS: C6 glioma cells were implanted into the right basal ganglia of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under stereotactic guided to create the glioma models. The models were sequentially undergone MRI and MRS examination on an 7T MR scanner designed for animals 7 days after the operation. Neuro metabolites were investigated from the center of the tumor, solid part of the tumor, peritumoral region, and contralateral white matter, and be quantified using the LCmodel software. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry and conventional hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were performed after the imaging protocol. RESULTS: Our results found that the inositol (Ins) and taurine (Tau) significantly defected in tumor peripheral compared to both tumor solid and normal tissues (P< 0.05). In contrast, the glutamate and glutamine (Glx) escalated and peaked at the tumor peripheral (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that Ins, Tau, and Glx have the potential to provide specific biomarkers for the location of tumor peripheral of glioma.

Title: Early Noninvasive Metabolic Biomarkers of Mutant IDH Inhibition in Glioma.
Abstract: Approximately 80% of low-grade glioma (LGGs) harbor mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) driver mutations leading to accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Thus, inhibition of mutant IDH is considered a potential therapeutic target. Several mutant IDH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, including AG-881 and BAY-1436032. However, to date, early detection of response remains a challenge. In this study we used high resolution (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to identify early noninvasive MR (Magnetic Resonance)-detectable metabolic biomarkers of response to mutant IDH inhibition. In vivo (1)H-MRS was performed on mice orthotopically-implanted with either genetically engineered (U87IDHmut) or patient-derived (BT257 and SF10417) mutant IDH1 cells. Treatment with either AG-881 or BAY-1436032 induced a significant reduction in 2-HG. Moreover, both inhibitors led to a significant early and sustained increase in glutamate and the sum of glutamate and glutamine (GLX) in all three models. A transient early increase in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was also observed. Importantly, all models demonstrated enhanced animal survival following both treatments and the metabolic alterations were observed prior to any detectable differences in tumor volume between control and treated tumors. Our study therefore identifies potential translatable early metabolic biomarkers of drug delivery, mutant IDH inhibition and glioma response to treatment with emerging clinically relevant therapies.

Title: Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Discrimination of Neoplastic and Non-Neoplastic Brain Lesions.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Differentiation of brain lesions by conventional MRI alone is not enough. The introduction of sophisticated imaging methods, such as MR Spectroscopy (MRS), will contribute to accurate differentiation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRS in differentiating neoplasm and non-neoplastic brain lesion. METHODOLOGY: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at Khartoum State from the period of 2015 to 2017. Thirty cases with brain lesions were included in the study investigated with MRS (Single-voxel spectroscopy) and conventional MRI. A comparison of MRS findings and histopathologic analysis was performed. The ratios of Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA were analyzed and compared between neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain masses. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: Out of the 30 patients affected with brain lesions, there were 16 females and 14 males with a mean age of 44 +- 18 years. The ratios of Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA were higher in gliomas, astrocytoma, and meningioma than non-neoplastic lesions. Kappa statistical value (K) showed a good agreement between MRS and histopathological analysis (K= 0.60). The diagnostic accuracy of MRS was 100%, with 82.60% sensitivity, 85.71% specificity, 95% PPV, and 60% NPV. CONCLUSION: MRS has high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating neoplasm from non-neoplastic brain tumors. The elevation ratios of Choline-to- N-acetyl aspartate and choline-to- creatine can help neurosurgeons and clinicians differentiate benign from malignant masses.

Title: Perfusion Parameter Obtained on 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the Ki-67 Labeling Index Predict the Overall Survival of Glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulsed arterial spin-labeling, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are useful for predicting glioma survival. We performed a comparative review of multiple parameters obtained using these pulse sequences on 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including the molecular status and Ki-67 labeling index in newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastomas. METHODS: A total of 35 patients with glioblastomas underwent pulsed arterial spin-labeling, DTI, and MRS studies using 3-Tesla MRI preoperatively. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, and Ki-67 labeling index were calculated from the tumor specimen. Cutoff values were identified by analyzing a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the multivariate survival statistical technique was performed to determine the significant and independent parameters for predicting overall survival. RESULTS: The multivariate Cox analysis showed that the maximum/mean relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) ratio and the Ki-67 labeling index were significant and independent predictive parameters with a cutoff value of 1.589 for the maximum rCBF ratio, 1.286 for the mean rCBF ratio, and 19% for the Ki-67 labeling index and hazard ratios of 6.132 and 5.119, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with higher rCBF ratios and Ki-67 labeling indices had a shorter overall survival than others, with median overall survival durations of 479 (95% CI, 370-559) and 1243 (95% CI, 666-NA) days, respectively (P = 0.000167). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the preoperative rCBF ratio and Ki-67 labeling index are useful parameters for predicting the overall survival of cerebral glioblastomas.

Title: Multimodality In Vivo Imaging of Perfusion and Glycolysis in a Rat Model of C6 Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI using an infusion of glucose (glucoCEST) is sensitive to the distribution of glucose in vivo; however, whether glucoCEST is more related to perfusion or glycolysis is still debatable. We compared glucoCEST to computed tomography perfusion (CTP), [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) in a C6 rat model of glioma to determine if glucoCEST is more strongly correlated with measurements of perfusion or glycolysis. METHODS: 10(6) C6 glioma cells were implanted in Wistar rat brains (n = 11). CTP (including blood volume, BV; blood flow, BF; and permeability surface area product, PS) and FDG-PET standardized uptake value (SUV) were acquired at 11 to 13 days post-surgery. GlucoCEST measurements (∆CEST) were acquired the following day on a 9.4 T MRI before and after an infusion of glucose solution. This was followed by MRSI on a 3.0 T MRI after the injection of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate to generate regional maps of the lactate:pyruvate ratio (Lac:Pyr). Pearson's correlations between glucoCEST, CTP, FDG-PET, and Lac:Pyr ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: Tumors had significantly higher SUV, BV, and PS than the contralateral brain. Tumor ∆CEST was most strongly correlated with CTP measurements of BV (rho = 0.74, P = 0.01) and PS (rho = 0.55, P = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between glycolysis measurements of SUV or Lac:Pyr with tumor ∆CEST. PS significantly correlated with SUV (rho = 0.58, P = 0.005) and Lac:Pyr (rho = 0.75, P = 0.005). BV significantly correlated with Lac:Pyr (rho = 0.57, P = 0.02), and BF significantly correlated with SUV (rho = 0.49, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study determined that glucoCEST is more strongly correlated to measurements of perfusion than glycolysis. GlucoCEST measurements have additional confounds, such as sensitivity to changing pH, that merit additional investigation.

Title: Advancements in Neuroimaging to Unravel Biological and Molecular Features of Brain Tumors.
Abstract: In recent years, the clinical assessment of primary brain tumors has been increasingly dependent on advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in order to infer tumor pathophysiological characteristics, such as hemodynamics, metabolism, and microstructure. Quantitative radiomic data extracted from advanced MRI have risen as potential in vivo noninvasive biomarkers for predicting tumor grades and molecular subtypes, opening the era of "molecular imaging" and radiogenomics. This review presents the most relevant advancements in quantitative neuroimaging of advanced MRI techniques, by means of radiomics analysis, applied to primary brain tumors, including lower-grade glioma and glioblastoma, with a special focus on peculiar oncologic entities of current interest. Novel findings from diffusion MRI (dMRI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) are hereby sifted in order to evaluate the role of quantitative imaging in neuro-oncology as a tool for predicting molecular profiles, stratifying prognosis, and characterizing tumor tissue microenvironments. Furthermore, innovative technological approaches are briefly addressed, including artificial intelligence contributions and ultra-high-field imaging new techniques. Lastly, after providing an overview of the advancements, we illustrate current clinical applications and future perspectives.

Title: Deep learning magnetic resonance spectroscopy fingerprints of brain tumours using quantum mechanically synthesised data.
Abstract: Metabolic fingerprints are valuable biomarkers for diseases that are associated with metabolic disorders. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a unique noninvasive diagnostic tool that can depict the metabolic fingerprint based solely on the proton signal of different molecules present in the tissue. However, its performance is severely hindered by low SNR, field inhomogeneities and overlapping spectra of metabolites, which affect the quantification of metabolites. Consequently, MRS is rarely included in routine clinical protocols and has not been proven in multi-institutional trials. This work proposes an alternative approach, where instead of quantifying metabolites' concentration, deep learning (DL) is used to model the complex nonlinear relationship between diseases and their spectroscopic metabolic fingerprint (pattern). DL requires large training datasets, acquired (ideally) with the same protocol/scanner, which are very rarely available. To overcome this limitation, a novel method is proposed that can quantum mechanically synthesise MRS data for any scanner/acquisition protocol. The proposed methodology is applied to the challenging clinical problem of differentiating metastasis from glioblastoma brain tumours on data acquired across multiple institutions. DL algorithms were trained on the augmented synthetic spectra and tested on two independent datasets acquired by different scanners, achieving a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of up to 0.96 and 0.97, respectively.

Title: Intraoperative imaging technology to maximise extent of resection for glioma: a network meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have identified the prognostic relevance of extent of resection in the management of glioma. Different intraoperative technologies have emerged in recent years with unknown comparative efficacy in optimising extent of resection. One previous Cochrane Review provided low- to very low-certainty evidence in single trial analyses and synthesis of results was not possible. The role of intraoperative technology in maximising extent of resection remains uncertain. Due to the multiple complementary technologies available, this research question is amenable to a network meta-analysis methodological approach. OBJECTIVES: To establish the comparative effectiveness and risk profile of specific intraoperative imaging technologies using a network meta-analysis and to identify cost analyses and economic evaluations as part of a brief economic commentary. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE via Ovid to May week 2 2020, and Embase via Ovid to 2020 week 20. We performed backward searching of all identified studies. We handsearched two journals, Neuro-oncology and the Journal of Neuro-oncology from 1990 to 2019 including all conference abstracts. Finally, we contacted recognised experts in neuro-oncology to identify any additional eligible studies and acquire information on ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs evaluating people of all ages with presumed new or recurrent glial tumours (of any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both). Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Interventions included fluorescence-guided surgery, intraoperative ultrasound, neuronavigation (with or without additional image processing, e.g. tractography), and intraoperative MRI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for relevance, undertook critical appraisal according to known guidelines, and extracted data using a prespecified pro forma. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four RCTs, using different intraoperative imaging technologies: intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) (2 trials, with 58 and 14 participants); fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (1 trial, 322 participants); and neuronavigation (1 trial, 45 participants). We identified one ongoing trial assessing iMRI with a planned sample size of 304 participants for which results are expected to be published around winter 2020. We identified no published trials for intraoperative ultrasound. Network meta-analyses or traditional meta-analyses were not appropriate due to absence of homogeneous trials across imaging technologies. Of the included trials, there was notable heterogeneity in tumour location and imaging technologies utilised in control arms. There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies. One trial of iMRI found increased extent of resection (risk ratio (RR) for incomplete resection was 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.96; 49 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and one trial of 5-ALA (RR for incomplete resection was 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.71; 270 participants; low-certainty evidence). The other trial assessing iMRI was stopped early after an unplanned interim analysis including 14 participants; therefore, the trial provided very low-quality evidence. The trial of neuronavigation provided insufficient data to evaluate the effects on extent of resection. Reporting of adverse events was incomplete and suggestive of significant reporting bias (very low-certainty evidence). Overall, the proportion of reported events was low in most trials and, therefore, issues with power to detect differences in outcomes that may or may not have been present. Survival outcomes were not adequately reported, although one trial reported no evidence of improvement in overall survival with 5-ALA (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07; 270 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data for quality of life were only available for one study and there was significant attrition bias (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative imaging technologies, specifically 5-ALA and iMRI, may be of benefit in maximising extent of resection in participants with high-grade glioma. However, this is based on low- to very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, the short- and long-term neurological effects are uncertain. Effects of image-guided surgery on overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life are unclear. Network and traditional meta-analyses were not possible due to the identified high risk of bias, heterogeneity, and small trials included in this review. A brief economic commentary found limited economic evidence for the equivocal use of iMRI compared with conventional surgery. In terms of costs, one non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that, compared with standard surgery, use of image-guided surgery has an uncertain effect on costs and that 5-ALA was more costly. Further research, including completion of ongoing trials of ultrasound-guided surgery, is needed.

Title: Non-invasive assessment of telomere maintenance mechanisms in brain tumors.
Abstract: Telomere maintenance is a universal hallmark of cancer. Most tumors including low-grade oligodendrogliomas use telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression for telomere maintenance while astrocytomas use the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Although TERT and ALT are hallmarks of tumor proliferation and attractive therapeutic targets, translational methods of imaging TERT and ALT are lacking. Here we show that TERT and ALT are associated with unique (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable metabolic signatures in genetically-engineered and patient-derived glioma models and patient biopsies. Importantly, we have leveraged this information to mechanistically validate hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]-alanine flux to pyruvate as an imaging biomarker of ALT status and hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]-alanine flux to lactate as an imaging biomarker of TERT status in low-grade gliomas. Collectively, we have identified metabolic biomarkers of TERT and ALT status that provide a way of integrating critical oncogenic information into non-invasive imaging modalities that can improve tumor diagnosis and treatment response monitoring.

Title: The Diagnostic Value of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in the Grading of Pediatric Gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aims of this retrospective study were to assess the value of the quantitative analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) metabolites in differentiating grades of pediatric gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and nine pathology-confirmed pediatric gliomas (143 low-grade gliomas [LGGs] and 66 high-grade gliomas [HGGs]) were retrospectively analyzed on preoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, of which 84 also underwent 1H-MRS. The mean tumor ADC (ADCmean), minimum tumor ADC (ADCmin), tumor/normal brain ADC ratio (ADC ratio), and metabolites (choline/creatine ratio [Cho/Cr], N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio [NAA/Cr], N-acetylaspartate/choline ratio [NAA/Cho], presence of lactate and lipid peaks) between LGGs and HGGs were analyzed. RESULTS: There were significant negative correlations between the ADC values and glioma grade. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the cutoff ADCmean value of 1.192 x 10-3 mm2/s for the differentiation between low- and high-grade pediatric gliomas provided a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 77.6%, 80.3%, 78.5%, 89.5% and 62.4%, respectively; the cutoff ADCmin value of 0.973 x 10-3 mm2/s resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 86.0%, 90.9%, 87.6%, 95.3%, and 75.0%, respectively; the cutoff ADC ratio value of 1.384 resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 73.4%, 87.9%, 78.0%, 92.9%, and 60.4%, respectively. A tendency for a positive correlation was found between Cho/Cr and glioma grade. A negative correlation was demonstrated between NAA/Cr or NAA/Cho and glioma grade. Statistical analysis demonstrated a threshold value of 2.601 for Cho/Cr to provide a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 81.8%, 51.7%, 71.4%, 76.3%, and 60.0%, respectively, in dividing LGGs and HGGs; a threshold value of 0.705 for NAA/Cr to provide a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 76.4%, 75.9%, 76.2%, 85.7%, and 62.9%, respectively; a threshold value of 0.349 for NAA/Cho to provide a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 87.3%, 86.2%, 86.9%, 92.3%, and 78.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ADC values and metabolites appeared to be significantly correlated to grade in pediatric gliomas. The predictive values may be helpful for preoperative diagnostic predictions.

Title: Higher Cho/NAA Ratio in Postoperative Peritumoral Edema Zone Is Associated With Earlier Recurrence of Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Objective: To explore the prognostic significance of metabolic parameters in postoperative peritumoral edema zone (PEZ) of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) based on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Methods: The postoperative MRS data of 67 patients with GBM from Beijing Tiantan Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Metabolite ratios including Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr in both postoperative PEZ and contralateral normal brain region were recorded. Log-rank analysis and Cox regression model were used to identify parameters correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Compared with the contralateral normal brain region, postoperative PEZ showed a lower ratio of NAA/Cr (1.20 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.81 +/- 0.48, P < 0.001), and higher ratios of Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA (1.36 +/- 0.44 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.27, P < 0.001 and 1.32 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.14, P < 0.001). Both the ratios of Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr were identified as prognostic factors in univariate analysis (P < 0.05), while only Cho/NAA >/= 1.31 was further confirmed as an independent risk factor for early recurrence in the Cox regression model (P < 0.01). According to the factors of MGMT promoter unmethylation, without radiotherapy and Cho/NAA >/= 1.31, a prognostic scoring scale for GBM was established, which could divide patients into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk groups. There was a significant difference of survival rate between the three groups (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher Cho/NAA ratio in the postoperative PEZ of GBM predicts earlier recurrence and is associated with poor prognosis. The prognostic scoring scale based on clinical, molecular and metabolic parameters of patients with GBM can help doctors to make more precise prediction of survival time and to adjust therapeutic regimens.

Title: Combined application of MRS and DWI can effectively predict cell proliferation and assess the grade of glioma: A prospective study.
Abstract: In order to assess combined application of MRS and DWI for prediction cell proliferation and grade diagnosis of glioma, We prospectively collected the Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, Cr/NAA of MRS and tumor parenchyma ADC (ADC(T)), contralateral mirror brain tissue ADC (ADC(H)), rADC (rADC = ADC(T)/ADC(H)). According to postoperative pathology, the patients were divided into two groups: LGG group and HGG group, compared differences of age, gender, Ki67, MRS, DWI between two groups. Next, we analyzed the correlation between MRS, DWI and Ki67. On this basis, the sensitivity and specificity of MRS, DWI and MRS combined with DWI (MRS + DWI) in diagnosis of glioma grade were evaluated. The differences of Ki67, Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, Cr/NAA, ADC(T), rADC between LGG group and HGG group were statistically significant (p = 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.008, 0.000, and 0.000 respectively). From ROC curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, Cr/NAA, ADC(T), rADC, PRE (MRS + DWI) were (0.901, 86.7%, 85.7%), (0.876, 80.0%, 82.1%), (0.704, 63.3%, 71.4%), (0.862, 82.1%, 83.3%), (0.820, 75.0%, 76.7%), (0.920, 86.7%, 89.3%), respectively. Fisher's linear discriminant functions results suggest: Y(1) = -20.447 + 3.46*X(1) + 17.141*X(2) (LGG), Y(2) = -19.415 + 4.828*X(1) + 14.543*X(2) (HGG). Our study suggested that MRS and DWI can effectively predict cell proliferation preoperative. MRS combined with DWI can further improve sensitivity and specificity in assessing the grade of glioma.

Title: Diffuse astrocytoma and the diagnostic dilemma of an unusual phenotype: A case report.
Abstract: Diffuse astrocytoma is an infiltrating type of glioma (World Health Organization grade II), which even with histopathology, is difficult to diagnose. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the cornerstone for diagnoses and follow-up of brain gliomas. This report describes a case of diffuse astrocytoma in a 48-year-old man who presented with sudden right-sided weakness and repeated convulsive attacks. On brain computed tomography, the case was diagnosed and treated as an acute infarction. Ten days later, the patient returned with a total loss of consciousness. Brain MRI images revealed an irregularly outlined lesion involving the splenium of the corpus callosum that extended into the left periventricular parietal lobe of the brain with cystic foci in the septum pellucidum. Contrast-enhanced and new sequences of MRI was helpful in approach to diagnosis because of its superior tissue characterization. The histopathology results ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma. The patient died postoperatively.

Title: SPectroscOpic prediction of bRain Tumours (SPORT): study protocol of a prospective imaging trial.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The revised 2016 WHO-Classification of CNS-tumours now integrates molecular information of glial brain tumours for accurate diagnosis as well as for the development of targeted therapies. In this prospective study, our aim is to investigate the predictive value of MR-spectroscopy in order to establish a solid preoperative molecular stratification algorithm of these tumours. We will process a 1H MR-spectroscopy sequence within a radiomics analytics pipeline. METHODS: Patients treated at our institution with WHO-Grade II, III and IV gliomas will receive preoperative anatomical (T2- and T1-weighted imaging with and without contrast enhancement) and proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) by using chemical shift imaging (MRS) (5 x 5 x 15 mm(3) voxel size). Tumour regions will be segmented and co-registered to corresponding spectroscopic voxels. Raw signals will be processed by a deep-learning approach for identifying patterns in metabolic data that provides information with respect to the histological diagnosis as well patient characteristics obtained and genomic data such as target sequencing and transcriptional data. DISCUSSION: By imaging the metabolic profile of a glioma using a customized chemical shift 1H MR spectroscopy sequence and by processing the metabolic profiles with a machine learning tool we intend to non-invasively uncover the genetic signature of gliomas. This work-up will support surgical and oncological decisions to improve personalized tumour treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was initially registered under another name and was later retrospectively registered under the current name at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) under DRKS00019855.

Title: Radiological and Immunostaining Characteristics of H3.3 G34R-Mutant Glioma: A Report of 3 Cases and Review of the Literature.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: H3.3 G34R/V mutation is predominantly identified in the supratentorial nonmidline tumors. However, this tumor is not yet categorized as an entity in 2016 WHO CNS classification. More information is necessary to further determine the characteristics of this tumor. CASE PRESENTATION: Three cases of adolescent hemispheric glioma were treated in our institution. All tumors showed the characteristics of huge tumor size with mild peritumoral edema on T2WI/FLAIR, hyperintense on DWI, and slight partial enhancement by gadolinium. The single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy revealed characteristics of high choline peak, marked decrease in N-acetyl aspartate peak, and small lactate peak. The histopathological diagnosis, based on 2007 WHO CNS classification, was high-grade glioma in 2 cases and a PNET. Immuno-staining revealed that the tumor cells were positive against H3.3 G34R, H3K27me3, and p53 antibodies and negative against H3K27M, IDH1-R132H, ATRX, and Olig2 antibodies. Pyrosequencing analysis confirmed H3.3 G34R mutation, IDH-wildtype, and BRAF-wildtype. CONCLUSION: Radiological and immunostaining findings are characteristic in our 3 cases of H3.3 G34-mutant glioma. It is essential to consider H3.3 G34-mutant glioma as a differential diagnosis particularly in pediatric and adolescents and young adult hemispheric tumors.

Title: The role of imaging for the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline update.
Abstract: TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with a newly diagnosed lesion with a suspected or histopathologically proven glioblastoma (GBM). QUESTION: What are the optimal imaging techniques to be used in the management of a suspected glioblastoma (GBM), specifically: which imaging sequences are critical for most accurately identifying or diagnosing a GBM and distinguishing this tumor from other tumor types? RECOMMENDATIONS: Critical Imaging for the Identification and Diagnosis of Glioblastoma Level II: In patients with a suspected GBM, it is recommended that the minimum magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam should be an anatomic exam with both T2 weighted, FLAIR and pre- and post-gadolinium contrast enhanced T1 weighted imaging. The addition of diffusion and perfusion weighted MR imaging can assist in the assessment of suspected GBM for the purposes of distinguishing GBM from other tumor types. Computed tomography (CT) can provide additional information regarding calcification or hemorrhage and also can be useful for subjects who are unable to undergo MR imaging. At a minimum, these anatomic sequences can help identify a lesion as well as its location, and potential for surgical intervention. Improvement of diagnostic specificity with the addition of non-anatomic (physiologic imaging) to anatomic imaging Level II: One blinded prospective study and a significant number of case series support the addition of diffusion and perfusion weighted MR imaging in the assessment of suspected GBM, for the purposes of distinguishing GBM from other tumor types (e.g., primary CNS lymphoma or metastases). Level III: It is suggested that magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and nuclear medicine imaging (PET 18F-FDG and 11C-MET) be used to provide additional support for the diagnosis of GBM.

Title: Non-Invasive Prediction of IDH Mutation in Patients with Glioma WHO II/III/IV Based on F-18-FET PET-Guided In Vivo (1)H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Machine Learning.
Abstract: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 mutation is an important prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in glioma. Immunohistological and molecular diagnosis of IDH mutation status is invasive. To avoid tumor biopsy, dedicated spectroscopic techniques have been proposed to detect D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), the main metabolite of IDH, directly in vivo. However, these methods are technically challenging and not broadly available. Therefore, we explored the use of machine learning for the non-invasive, inexpensive and fast diagnosis of IDH status in standard (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). To this end, 30 of 34 consecutive patients with known or suspected glioma WHO grade II-IV were subjected to metabolic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) for optimized voxel placement in (1)H-MRS. Routine (1)H-magnetic resonance ((1)H-MR) spectra of tumor and contralateral healthy brain regions were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance (3T-MR) scanner, prior to surgical tumor resection and molecular analysis of IDH status. Since 2-HG spectral signals were too overlapped for reliable discrimination of IDH mutated (IDHmut) and IDH wild-type (IDHwt) glioma, we used a nested cross-validation approach, whereby we trained a linear support vector machine (SVM) on the complete spectral information of the (1)H-MRS data to predict IDH status. Using this approach, we predicted IDH status with an accuracy of 88.2%, a sensitivity of 95.5% (95% CI, 77.2-99.9%) and a specificity of 75.0% (95% CI, 42.9-94.5%), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) amounted to 0.83. Subsequent ex vivo (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) measurements performed on metabolite extracts of resected tumor material (eight specimens) revealed myo-inositol (M-ins) and glycine (Gly) to be the major discriminators of IDH status. We conclude that our approach allows a reliable, non-invasive, fast and cost-effective prediction of IDH status in a standard clinical setting.

Title: Non-Invasive Measurement of Drug and 2-HG Signals Using (19)F and (1)H MR Spectroscopy in Brain Tumors Treated with the Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor BAY1436032.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: BAY1436032 is a fluorine-containing inhibitor of the R132X-mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (mIDH1). It inhibits the mIDH1-mediated production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in glioma cells. We investigated brain penetration of BAY1436032 and its effects using (1)H/(19)F-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). METHODS: (19)F-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy was conducted on serum samples from patients treated with BAY1436032 (NCT02746081 trial) in order to analyze (19)F spectroscopic signal patterns and concentration-time dynamics of protein-bound inhibitor to facilitate their identification in vivo MRS experiments. Hereafter, 30 mice were implanted with three glioma cell lines (LNT-229, LNT-229 IDH1-R132H, GL261). Mice bearing the IDH-mutated glioma cells received 5 days of treatment with BAY1436032 between baseline and follow-up (1)H/(19)F-MRS scan. All other animals underwent a single scan after BAY1436032 administration. Mouse brains were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Evaluation of (1)H-MRS data showed a decrease in 2-HG/total creatinine (tCr) ratios from the baseline to post-treatment scans in the mIDH1 murine model. Whole brain concentration of BAY1436032, as determined by (19)F-MRS, was similar to total brain tissue concentration determined by Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with a signal loss due to protein binding. Intratumoral drug concentration, as determined by LC-MS/MS, was not statistically different in models with or without R132X-mutant IDH1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive monitoring of mIDH1 inhibition by BAY1436032 in mIDH1 gliomas is feasible.

Title: Multimodal MR Features of 8 Cases of Epithelioid Glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The MRI features of epithelioid glioblastoma (eGBM) were analyzed. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MR perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings were quantitatively analyzed. METHODS: The MRI images of 8 cases of eGBM were analyzed retrospectively. The location and edge, signal, peritumoral edema, adjacent meningeal invasion, and enhancement of the lesions were observed. The ADC value, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and N-acetylaspartate/acetylcholine (NAA/Cho) value were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 8 patients, the tumors were mainly located in the temporal lobe (n = 3), frontal lobe (n = 3), and parietal lobe (n = 2). The lesion boundary was clear in 6 cases and unclear in 2. The lesions were superficial in 5 cases and in the deep white matter in 3. Internal hemorrhage was observed in 4 cases. There was cystic necrosis in 7 cases, and only 1 case was solid without cystic necrosis. There was no edema around the lesion in 1 case, severe edema in 5, and moderate edema in 2. In 4 cases, the adjacent meninges were involved, and in 1 case, the ependyma was involved. Two patients developed leptomeningeal metastasis within 2 months after the operation. The average ADC value of the tumor parenchyma among all 8 patients was7.15 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s,which was 17.6% lower than that of the contralateral side. The Cho/NAA metabolite ratio was 5.27 and 0.81 in the lesions of 2 patients. The rCBV was 3.51 ml/100 g and 3.32 ml/100 g of lesions in 2 patients; these values were 36% and 29% higher, respectively, than those of the contralateral side. The rCBF was 31.5 ml/100 g/min and 82.1 ml/100 g/min of lesions in two patients; these values were 49% and 203% higher, respectively, than those of the contralateral side. CONCLUSION: eGBM characteristics include a superficial location, easy cyst degeneration, easy necrosis and hemorrhage, and clear boundaries. It easily invades adjacent meninges and shows cerebrospinal fluid dissemination and metastasis. Combining new MR techniques, such as ADC values, PWI, and MRS, could be helpful for improving diagnostic accuracy.

Title: Correlations between DTI-derived metrics and MRS metabolites in tumour regions of glioblastoma: a pilot study.
Abstract: Introduction Specific correlations among diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived metrics and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) metabolite ratios in brains with glioblastoma are still not completely understood. Patients and methods We made retrospective cohort study. MRS ratios (choline-to-N-acetyl aspartate [Cho/NAA], lipids and lactate to creatine [LL/Cr], and myo-inositol/creatine [mI/Cr]) were correlated with eleven DTI biomarkers: mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), pure isotropic diffusion (p), pure anisotropic diffusion (q), the total magnitude of the diffusion tensor (L), linear tensor (Cl), planar tensor (Cp), spherical tensor (Cs), relative anisotropy (RA), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) at the same regions: enhanced rim, peritumoral oedema and normal-appearing white matter. Correlational analyses of 546 MRS and DTI measurements used Spearman coefficient. Results At the enhancing rim we found four significant correlations: FA <--> LL/Cr, Rs = -.364, p = .034; Cp <--> LL/Cr, Rs = .362, p = .035; q <--> LL/Cr, Rs = -.349, p = .035; RA <--> LL/Cr, Rs = -.357, p = .038. Another ten pairs of significant correlations were found in the peritumoral edema: AD <--> LL/Cr, AD <--> mI/Cr, MD <--> LL/Cr, MD <--> mI/Cr, p <--> LL/Cr, p <--> mI/ Cr, RD <--> mI/Cr, RD <--> mI/Cr, L <--> LL/Cr, L <--> mI/Cr. Conclusions DTI and MRS biomarkers answer different questions; peritumoral oedema represents the biggest challenge with at least ten significant correlations between DTI and MRS that need additional studies. The fact that DTI and MRS measures are not specific of one histologic type of tumour broadens their application to a wider variety of intracranial pathologies.

Title: Glutamate Is a Noninvasive Metabolic Biomarker of IDH1-Mutant Glioma Response to Temozolomide Treatment.
Abstract: Although lower grade gliomas are driven by mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene and are less aggressive than primary glioblastoma, they nonetheless generally recur. IDH1-mutant patients are increasingly being treated with temozolomide, but early detection of response remains a challenge and there is a need for complementary imaging methods to assess response to therapy prior to tumor shrinkage. The goal of this study was to determine the value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based metabolic changes for detection of response to temozolomide in both genetically engineered and patient-derived mutant IDH1 models. Using (1)H MRS in combination with chemometrics identified several metabolic alterations in temozolomide-treated cells, including a significant increase in steady-state glutamate levels. This was confirmed in vivo, where the observed (1)H MRS increase in glutamate/glutamine occurred prior to tumor shrinkage. Cells labeled with [1-(13)C]glucose and [3-(13)C]glutamine, the principal sources of cellular glutamate, showed that flux to glutamate both from glucose via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and from glutamine were increased following temozolomide treatment. In line with these results, hyperpolarized [5-(13)C]glutamate produced from [2-(13)C]pyruvate and hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]glutamate produced from [1-(13)C]alpha-ketoglutarate were significantly higher in temozolomide-treated cells compared with controls. Collectively, our findings identify (1)H MRS-detectable elevation of glutamate and hyperpolarized (13)C MRS-detectable glutamate production from either pyruvate or alpha-ketoglutarate as potential translatable metabolic biomarkers of response to temozolomide treatment in mutant IDH1 glioma. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that glutamate can be used as a noninvasive, imageable metabolic marker for early assessment of tumor response to temozolomide, with the potential to improve treatment strategies for mutant IDH1 patients.

Title: Main genetic differences in high-grade gliomas may present different MR imaging and MR spectroscopy correlates.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the main genetic differences observed in high-grade gliomas (HGG) will present different MR imaging and MR spectroscopy correlates that could be used to better characterize lesions in the clinical setting. METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with histologically confirmed HGG were recruited. Immunohistochemistry analyses for isocitrate dehydrogenase gene 1 (IDH1), alpha thalassemia mental retardation X-linked gene (ATRX), Ki-67, and p53 protein expression were performed. Tumour radiological features were examined on MR images. Metabolic profile and infiltrative pattern were assessed with MR spectroscopy. MR features were analysed to identify imaging-molecular associations. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox regression model were used to identify survival prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 17.7% of the lesions were IDH1-mutated, 8.9% presented ATRX-mutated, 70.9% presented p53 unexpressed, and 22.8% had Ki-67 > 5%. IDH1 wild-type tumours had higher levels of mobile lipids (p = 0.001). The tumour-infiltrative pattern was higher in HGG with unexpressed p53 (p = 0.009). Mutated ATRX tumours presented higher levels of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) (p = 0.001). An association was observed between Glx tumour levels (p = 0.038) and Ki-67 expression (p = 0.008) with the infiltrative pattern. Survival analyses identified IDH1 status, age, and tumour choline levels as independent predictors of prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IDH1-wt tumours are more necrotic than IDH1-mut. And that the presence of an infiltrative pattern in HGG is associated with loss of p53 expression, Ki-67 index, and Glx levels. Finally, tumour choline levels could be used as a predictive factor in survival in addition to the IDH1 status to provide a more accurate prediction of survival in HGG patients. KEY POINTS: * IDH1-wt tumours present higher levels of mobile lipids than IDH1-mut. * Mutated ATRX tumours exhibit higher levels of glutamate and glutamine. * Loss of p53 expression, Ki-67 expression, and glutamate and glutamine levels may contribute to the presence of an infiltrative pattern in HGG.

Title: The diagnostic performance of 99mTc-methionine single-photon emission tomography in grading glioma preoperatively: a comparison with histopathology and Ki-67 indices.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To characterize glioma preoperatively using quantitative 99mTc-methionine SPECT and comparison with MR-perfusion/spectroscopy and histopatholgical/Ki-67 scoring. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (21M: 8F; mean age 42.3 +/- 10.5 years) with clinical and radiological suspicion of glioma assessed by 99mTc-MDM/SPECT and ceMRI. Additionally, 12/29 patients underwent dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSCE) MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination. Three patients with benign pathologies were recruited as controls. Histopathological tumor analysis was done in all (n = 29) the patients, and the Ki-67 index was evaluated in 20/29 patients. The target-to-nontarget (T/NT) methionine tumor uptake ratios, normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) and metabolites [choline/N-acetyl aspartate (Cho/NAA), Cho/creatine (Cr), Cr/NAA and Cr/Cho) ratios were measured in tumor areas. RESULTS: On histopathological analysis, 26/29 patients had glioma (G IV-13; G III-04; G II-09). The mean T/NT ratio in G-II was significantly lower (2.46 +/- 2.3) than in G-III (7.13 +/- 2.2) and G-IV (5.16 +/- 1.2). However, the mean ratio was highest (15.9 +/- 6.8) in meningioma (n=3). The T/NT cutoff ratio of 3.08 provided 100% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity for discriminating high-grade glioma (HGG) from low-grade glioma (LGG) disease. Likewise, the nCBV cutoff of 2.43 offered 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Only the Cho/NAA cutoff value of greater than 3.34 provided reasonable sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 80.0% respectively for this differentiation. T/NT ratio correlated significantly with nCBV and Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr ratios but not with Ki-67. CONCLUSION: Quantitative 99mTc-MDM -SPECT provided high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate HGG versus LGG preoperatively and demonstrated a potential role for the differential diagnosis of glial versus nonglial tumors.

Title: MR-detectable metabolic biomarkers of response to mutant IDH inhibition in low-grade glioma.
Abstract: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1mut) are reported in 70-90% of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. IDH1mut catalyzes the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite which drives tumorigenesis. Inhibition of IDH1mut is therefore an emerging therapeutic approach, and inhibitors such as AG-120 and AG-881 have shown promising results in phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. However, detection of response to these therapies prior to changes in tumor growth can be challenging. The goal of this study was to identify non-invasive clinically translatable metabolic imaging biomarkers of IDH1mut inhibition that can serve to assess response. Methods: IDH1mut inhibition was confirmed using an enzyme assay and (1)H- and (13)C- magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were used to investigate the metabolic effects of AG-120 and AG-881 on two genetically engineered IDH1mut-expressing cell lines, NHAIDH1mut and U87IDH1mut. Results:(1)H-MRS indicated a significant decrease in steady-state 2-HG following treatment, as expected. This was accompanied by a significant (1)H-MRS-detectable increase in glutamate. However, other metabolites previously linked to 2-HG were not altered. (13)C-MRS also showed that the steady-state changes in glutamate were associated with a modulation in the flux of glutamine to both glutamate and 2-HG. Finally, hyperpolarized (13)C-MRS was used to show that the flux of alpha-KG to both glutamate and 2-HG was modulated by treatment. Conclusion: In this study, we identified potential (1)H- and (13)C-MRS-detectable biomarkers of response to IDH1mut inhibition in gliomas. Although further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of these biomarkers in vivo, we expect that in addition to a (1)H-MRS-detectable drop in 2-HG, a (1)H-MRS-detectable increase in glutamate, as well as a hyperpolarized (13)C-MRS-detectable change in [1-(13)C] alpha-KG flux, could serve as metabolic imaging biomarkers of response to treatment.

Title: Different Mechanisms Underlie the Metabolic Response of GBM Stem-Like Cells to Ionizing Radiation: Biological and MRS Studies on Effects of Photons and Carbon Ions.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant primary brain tumor with very poor prognosis, high recurrence rate, and failure of chemo-radiotherapy, mainly due to a small fraction of cells with stem-like properties (GSCs). To study the mechanisms of GSCs resistance to radiation, two GSC lines, named line #1 and line #83, with different metabolic patterns and clinical outcome, were irradiated with photon beams and carbon ions and assessed by (1)H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Both irradiation modalities induced early cytotoxic effects in line #1 with small effects on cell cycle, whereas a proliferative G2/M cytostatic block was observed in line #83. MR spectroscopy signals from mobile lipids (ML) increased in spectra of line #1 after photon and C-ion irradiation with effects on lipid unsaturation level, whereas no effects were detected in line #83 spectra. Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), glutamic acid (glu) and Phosphocreatine (pCr) signals showed a significant variation only for line #1 after carbon ion irradiation. Glucose (glc) level and lactate (Lac) extrusion behaved differently in the two lines. Our findings suggest that the differences in irradiation response of GSCs #1 and #83 lines are likely attributable to their different metabolic fingerprint rather than to the different radiation types.

Title: Case report: narcolepsy type 2 due to temporal lobe glioma.
Abstract: RATIONALE: The orexin projection system includes the lateral hypothalamus, reticular activating structure, and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and this system is related to the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more. INTERVENTIONS: The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out. OUTCOMES: General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately. He scored 3 on the Epworth sleepiness scale. During our follow-up three months later, he remained well with no complications. DIAGNOSIS: We diagnosed the patient with narcolepsy type 2 according to the 3rd Edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3). CONCLUSION: The patient suffered from EDS and was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The narcolepsy type 2 was linked to glioma of the hippocampus area. The hippocampus might be another part of regulating the sleep-arousal pathway, and the glioma secretion might interact with the orexin projection system.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutated gliomas: current knowledge on the neurochemical profile.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may play a key role for the management of patients with glioma. We highlighted the utility of MRS in the noninvasive diagnosis of gliomas with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes, by providing an overview of the neurochemical alterations observed in different glioma subtypes, as well as during treatment and progression, both in vivo and ex vivo. RECENT FINDINGS: D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) decrease during anticancer treatments was recently shown to be associated with altered levels of other metabolites, including lactate, glutamate and glutathione, suggesting that tumour treatment leads to a metabolic reprogramming beyond 2HG depletion. In combination with 2HG quantification, cystathionine and glycine seem to be the most promising candidates for higher specific identification of glioma subtypes and follow-up of disease progression and response to treatment. SUMMARY: The implementation of advanced MRS methods in the routine clinical practice will allow the quantification of metabolites that are not detectable with conventional methods and may enable immediate, accurate diagnosis of gliomas, which is crucial for planning optimal therapeutic strategies and follow-up examinations. The role of different metabolites as predictors of patient outcome still needs to be elucidated.

Title: [(99m)Tc]-Bis-Methionine-DTPA Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography Impacting Glioma Management: A Sensitive Indicator for Postsurgical/Chemoradiotherapy Response Assessment.
Abstract: Background: The present study evaluated the prognostic value of [(99m)Tc]MDM (bis-methionine-DTPA) follow-up single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for response assessment to chemoradiotherapy in glioma postoperatively. Materials and Methods: One hundred fourteen glioma patients (80 M:34 F) were followed postoperatively by sequential [(99m)Tc]MDM SPECT, dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSCE)-MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at baseline, 6, 12, and 22.5 months postchemoradiotherapy. The quantitative imaging results and the clinical outcome were used for response assessment and for the final diagnosis. The quantitative parameter of [(99m)Tc]MDM SPECT were also used for survival analysis. Results: A significantly (p = 0.001) lower target to nontarget (T/NT) ratio was observed in responders than in nonresponders. The sensitivity and specificity of [(99m)Tc]MDM-SPECT for identifying tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis at a cutoff ratio of 1.90 were estimated at 97.9% and 92%. Whereas, the sensitivity and specificity of DSCE-MRI with the normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) cutoff of 3.32 for this differentiation was found to be 84.6% and 93.0%. MRS intensity ratios of Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr provided comparatively lower sensitivity of 81.0% and 85.3% and specificity of 73.0% and 73.7%. T/NT ratios correlated with nCBV (r = 0.775, p < 0.001) and to a moderate extent with Cho/NAA ratios (r = 0.467, p = 0.001). [(99m)Tc]MDM SPECT and DSCE-MRI provided comparable results for predicting response assessment to chemoradiotherapy. There was a final diagnosis in 72 patients, of which 47 cases were tumor recurrence and 25 were radiation necrosis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with T/NT ratio <1.9 showed prolonged survival (53.8 months) as compared (37.2 months) with those who demonstrated T/NT ratio >1.9 (p = 0.0001). Conclusion: Thus, this low-cost SPECT technique in combination with DSCE-MRI can be used accurately for mapping the disease activity, response assessment, and survival in glioma. [(99m)Tc]MDM SPECT and DSCE-MRI had the same diagnostic efficacy to detect recurrent/residual tumor and radiation necrosis while MRS was inferior to both the techniques.

Title: State-of-the-art imaging for glioma surgery.
Abstract: Diffuse gliomas are infiltrative primary brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite multimodal treatment. Maximum safe resection is recommended whenever feasible. The extent of resection (EOR) is positively correlated with survival. Identification of glioma tissue during surgery is difficult due to its diffuse nature. Therefore, glioma resection is imaging-guided, making the choice for imaging technique an important aspect of glioma surgery. The current standard for resection guidance in non-enhancing gliomas is T2 weighted or T2w-fluid attenuation inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in enhancing gliomas T1-weighted MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Other MRI sequences, like magnetic resonance spectroscopy, imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography, as well as intraoperative imaging techniques, including the use of fluorescence, are also available for the guidance of glioma resection. The neurosurgeon's goal is to find the balance between maximizing the EOR and preserving brain functions since surgery-induced neurological deficits result in lower quality of life and shortened survival. This requires localization of important brain functions and white matter tracts to aid the pre-operative planning and surgical decision-making. Visualization of brain functions and white matter tracts is possible with functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography, and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this review, we discuss the current available imaging techniques for the guidance of glioma resection and the localization of brain functions and white matter tracts.

Title: Liposome Consolidated with Cyclodextrin Provides Prolonged Drug Retention Resulting in Increased Drug Bioavailability in Brain.
Abstract: Although butylidenephthalide (BP) is an efficient anticancer drug, its poor bioavailability renders it ineffective for treating drug-resistant brain tumors. However, this problem is overcome through the use of noninvasive delivery systems, including intranasal administration. Herein, the bioavailability, drug stability, and encapsulation efficiency (EE, up to 95%) of BP were improved by using cyclodextrin-encapsulated BP in liposomal formulations (CDD1). The physical properties and EE of the CDD1 system were investigated via dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity was examined via MTT assay, and the cellular uptake was observed using fluorescence microscopy. The CDD1 system persisted for over 8 h in tumor cells, which was a considerable improvement in the retention of the BP-containing cyclodextrin or the BP-containing liposomes, thereby indicating a higher BP content in CDD1. Nanoscale CDD1 formulations were administered intranasally to nude mice that had been intracranially implanted with temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma multiforme cells, resulting in increased median survival time. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that drug biodistribution via intranasal delivery increased the accumulation of BP 10-fold compared to oral delivery methods. Therefore, BP/cyclodextrin/liposomal formulations have potential clinical applications for treating drug-resistant brain tumors.

Title: COVID-19-Associated Encephalitis Mimicking Glial Tumor.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Reports on neurologic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have attracted broad attention. We present an unusual case of COVID-19-associated encephalitis mimicking a glial tumor. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman presented with headache and seizures. T2 fluid-attenuated inverse recovery imaging showed hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an elevated choline peak. Imaging findings were suggestive of high-grade glioma. Antiepileptic medication failed to achieve seizure control. A left anterior temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient had no postoperative deficits, and her symptoms completely improved. Histologic examination revealed encephalitis. Postoperatively, our patient tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our case raises awareness of neurologic manifestations of the disease and their potential to mimic glial tumors. For prompt diagnosis and prevention of transmission, clinicians should consider COVID-19 in patients with similar presentation.

Title: Analysis of Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumor Metabolites Using Multivoxel Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadly type of primary brain tumor in adults. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive imaging technique used to study metabolic changes in the brain tumors. Some metabolites such as Phosphocholine, Creatine, NAA/Cr, and Pcho/Cr have been proven to show a diagnostic role in GBM. The present study was conducted to analyze important metabolites using MRS multivoxel in GBM tumor. METHODS: In this study, information was collected from 8 individuals diagnosed with GBM using Siemens multivoxel MRS with a magnetic field strength of 3 T. Data were obtained by Point-Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) protocol with TE=135 ms and TR=1570 ms. NAA, Pcho, Cr, Ala, Gln, Gly, Glu, Lac, NAAG, and Tau metabolites were extracted and evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Given total number of normal voxels and total number of all voxels, levels of Cr, Glu, NAA, NAAG, and Gly/Tau ratio in healthy voxels were significantly higher than tumoral voxels (p=0.005, p=0.03, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.041, respectively). In contrast, levels of Gly, Gln, Tau, Lac/Cr, Pcho/Cr, Pcho/NAA, Lac/NAA, and Gln/Glu ratios in tumoral voxels were significantly more than healthy voxels (p=0.001, p= 0.037, p<0.001, p=0.010, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.024, respectively). However, levels of Lac and Pcho had no significant difference in the two types of voxels. CONCLUSION: In summary, compared to patients with glioblastoma with (1)H-MRS, the Pcho/Cr and Pcho/NAA ratios, and NAAG are the most important parameters to differentiate between tumoral and normal voxels.

Title: 2,4-Thiazolidinedione as Precursor to the Synthesis of Compounds with Anti-glioma Activities in C6 and GL261 Cells.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) represent an important class of heterocyclic compounds that have versatile biological activities, including anticancer activity. Glioma is one of the most common primary brain tumors, and it is responsible for most of the deaths caused by primary brain tumors. In the present work, 2,4-thiazolidinediones were synthesized via a multicomponent microwave one-pot procedure. The cytotoxicity of compounds was analyzed in vitro using rat (C6) and mouse (GL261) glioblastoma cell lines and primary cultures of astrocytes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize and characterize 2,4-thiazolidinediones and evaluate their antitumor activity. METHODS: TZDs were synthesized from three components: 2,4-thiazolidinedione, arene-aldehydes, and aryl chlorides. The reactions were carried out inside a microwave and monitored using thinlayer chromatography (TLC). Compounds were identified and characterized using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (CG-MS) and hydrogen ((1)H-NMR) and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C-NMR). The antitumor activity was analyzed using the 3-(4,5- dimethyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction test, in which cell viability was verified in the primary cultures of astrocytes and in rat and mouse glioblastoma cells exposed to the synthesized compounds. The cytotoxicity of all derivatives was analyzed at the 100 muM concentration, both in astrocytes and in the mouse and rat glioblastoma cell lines. The compounds that showed the best results, 4CI and 4DI, were also tested at concentrations 25, 50, 100, 175, and 250 muM to obtain the IC(50). RESULTS: Seventeen TZD derivatives were easily obtained through one-pot reactions in 40 minutes with yields ranging from 12% to 49%. All compounds were cytotoxic to both glioblastoma cell lines without being toxic to the astrocyte primary cell line at 100 muM, thus demonstrating a selective activity. Compounds 4CI and 4DI showed the best results in the C6 cells: IC(50) of 28.51 muM and 54.26 muM, respectively. CONCLUSION: The compounds were not cytotoxic in astrocyte culture, demonstrating selectivity for malignant cells. Changes in both rings are important for anti-glioma activity in the cell lines tested. TZD 4CI had the best anti-glioma activity.

Title: Emerging MRI Techniques to Redefine Treatment Response in Patients With Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common and most malignant primary brain tumor. Despite aggressive multimodal treatment, its prognosis remains poor. Even with continuous developments in MRI, which has provided us with newer insights into the diagnosis and understanding of tumor biology, response assessment in the posttherapy setting remains challenging. We believe that the integration of additional information from advanced neuroimaging techniques can further improve the diagnostic accuracy of conventional MRI. In this article, we review the utility of advanced neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical exchange saturation transfer in characterizing and evaluating treatment response in patients with glioblastoma. We will also discuss the existing challenges and limitations of using these techniques in clinical settings and possible solutions to avoiding pitfalls in study design, data acquisition, and analysis for future studies.

Title: A Case of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Mimic Neuromyelitis Optica.
Abstract: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is rare. And the symptoms of PCNSL are atypical, it is extremely easy to be misdiagnosed as other diseases. However, early treatment is crucial which is requesting early diagnosis. We report a case of a 47-year-old man who was initially diagnosed as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) on the basis of clinical findings, slightly high Aquaporin4 (AQP4) (1:10) and high signals of magnetic resonance imaging. Though his symptoms progressively improved after steroid pulse treatment, but worse when steroid was decreased to 40 mg per day. We considered the patient should be diagnosed as PCNSL. After the examination of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET), the results indicated PCNSL was most possible. Therefore we gave him stereotactic biopsy of deep of supratentorial, which showed non-Hodgkin malignant B-cell lymphoma.

Title: Hyperpolarized (13)C MRI: A novel approach for probing cerebral metabolism in health and neurological disease.
Abstract: Cerebral metabolism is tightly regulated and fundamental for healthy neurological function. There is increasing evidence that alterations in this metabolism may be a precursor and early biomarker of later stage disease processes. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is a powerful tool to non-invasively assess tissue metabolites and has many applications for studying the normal and diseased brain. However, the technique has limitations including low spatial and temporal resolution, difficulties in discriminating overlapping peaks, and challenges in assessing metabolic flux rather than steady-state concentrations. Hyperpolarized carbon-13 magnetic resonance imaging is an emerging clinical technique that may overcome some of these spatial and temporal limitations, providing novel insights into neurometabolism in both health and in pathological processes such as glioma, stroke and multiple sclerosis. This review will explore the growing body of pre-clinical data that demonstrates a potential role for the technique in assessing metabolism in the central nervous system. There are now a number of clinical studies being undertaken in this area and this review will present the emerging clinical data as well as the potential future applications of hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance imaging in the brain, in both clinical and pre-clinical studies.

Title: Imaging of skull vault tumors in adults.
Abstract: The skull vault, formed by the flat bones of the skull, has a limited spectrum of disease that lies between the fields of neuro- and musculoskeletal radiology. Its unique abnormalities, as well as other ubiquitous ones, present particular features in this location. Moreover, some benign entities in this region may mimic malignancy if analyzed using classical bone-tumor criteria, and proper patient management requires being familiar with these presentations. This article is structured as a practical review offering a systematic diagnostic approach to focal calvarial lesions, broadly organized into four categories: (1) pseudolesions: arachnoid granulations, meningo-/encephaloceles, vascular canals, frontal hyperostosis, parietal thinning, parietal foramina, and sinus pericrani; (2) lytic: fibrous dysplasia, epidermal inclusion and dermoid cysts, eosinophilic granuloma, hemangioma, aneurysmal bone cyst, giant cell tumor, metastasis, and myeloma; (3) sclerotic: osteomas, osteosarcoma, and metastasis; (4) transdiploic: meningioma, hemangiopericytoma, lymphoma, and metastasis, along with other less common entities. Tips on the potential usefulness of functional imaging techniques such as MR dynamic susceptibility (T2*) perfusion, MR spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and PET imaging are provided.

Title: Glycine by MR spectroscopy is an imaging biomarker of glioma aggressiveness.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas likely remodel the metabolic machinery to meet the increased demands for amino acids and nucleotides during rapid cell proliferation. Glycine, a non-essential amino acid and intermediate of nucleotide biosynthesis, may increase with proliferation. Non-invasive measurement of glycine by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was evaluated as an imaging biomarker for assessment of tumor aggressiveness. METHODS: We measured glycine, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), and other tumor-related metabolites in 35 glioma patients using an MRS sequence tailored for co-detection of glycine and 2HG in gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing tumor regions on 3T MRI. Glycine and 2HG concentrations as measured by MRS were correlated with tumor cell proliferation (MIB-1 labeling index), expression of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2), and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) enzymes, and patient overall survival. RESULTS: Elevated glycine was strongly associated with presence of gadolinium enhancement, indicating more rapidly proliferative disease. Glycine concentration was positively correlated with MIB-1, and levels higher than 2.5 mM showed significant association with shorter patient survival, irrespective of isocitrate dehydrogenase status. Concentration of 2HG did not correlate with MIB-1 index. A high glycine/2HG concentration ratio, >2.5, was strongly associated with shorter survival (P < 0.0001). GLDC and SHMT2 expression were detectable in all tumors with glycine concentration, demonstrating an inverse correlation with GLDC. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that aggressive gliomas reprogram glycine-mediated one-carbon metabolism to meet the biosynthetic demands for rapid cell proliferation. MRS evaluation of glycine provides a non-invasive metabolic imaging biomarker that is predictive of tumor progression and clinical outcome. KEY POINTS: 1. Glycine and 2-hydroxyglutarate in glioma patients are precisely co-detected using MRS at 3T.2. Tumors with elevated glycine proliferate and progress rapidly.3. A high glycine/2HG ratio is predictive of shortened patient survival.

Title: Intraoperative 3-T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for Detection of Proliferative Remnants of Glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the usefulness of intraoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (iMRS) for identifying abnormal signals at the resection margin during glioma surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the value of iMRS for detecting proliferative remnants of glioma at the resection margin. METHODS: Fifteen patients with newly diagnosed glioma underwent single-voxel 3-T iMRS concurrently with intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-assisted surgery. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were placed at T2-hyperintense or contrast-enhancing lesions at the resection margin. In addition to technical verification, the correlation between the MIB-1 labeling index (a pathologic feature) and metabolites measured using iMRS (N-acetyl-L-aspartate [NAA], choline [Cho], and Cho/NAA ratio) was analyzed. RESULTS: iMRS was performed for 20 VOIs in 15 patients. Fourteen (70%) of these VOIs were confirmed to be MIB-1-positive. There was a significant positive correlation between the Cho/NAA ratio and MIB-1 index (r = 0.46, P = 0.04). Cho level (P = 0.003) and Cho/NAA ratio (P = 0.002) were significantly higher in VOIs that were MIB-1-positive than in those that were MIB-1-negative. Detection of a Cho level >1.074 mM and a Cho/NAA ratio >0.48 using iMRS resulted in high diagnostic accuracy for MIB-1-positive remnants (Cho level: sensitivity 86%, specificity 100%; Cho/NAA ratio: sensitivity 79%, specificity 100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that 3-T iMRS can detect proliferative remnants of glioma at the resection margin using the Cho level and Cho/NAA ratio, suggesting that intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-assisted surgery with iMRS would be practicable in glioma.

Title: Multi-parametric MR Imaging Biomarkers Associated to Clinical Outcomes in Gliomas: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence regarding the association of multiparametric biomarkers with clinical outcomes and their capacity to explain relevant subcompartments of gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scopus database was searched for original journal papers from January 1st, 2007 to February 20th, 2017 according to PRISMA. Four hundred forty-nine abstracts of papers were reviewed and scored independently by two out of six authors. Based on those papers we analyzed associations between biomarkers, subcompartments within the tumor lesion, and clinical outcomes. From all the articles analyzed, the twenty-seven papers with the highest scores were highlighted to represent the evidence about MR imaging biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. Similarly, eighteen studies defining subcompartments within the tumor region were also highlighted to represent the evidence of MR imaging biomarkers. Their reports were critically appraised according to the QUADAS-2 criteria. RESULTS: It has been demonstrated that multi-parametric biomarkers are prepared for surrogating diagnosis, grading, segmentation, overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence, molecular profiling and response to treatment in gliomas. Quantifications and radiomics features obtained from morphological exams (T1, T2, FLAIR, T1c), PWI (including DSC and DCE), diffusion (DWI, DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI) are the preferred MR biomarkers associated to clinical outcomes. Subcompartments relative to the peritumoral region, invasion, infiltration, proliferation, mass effect and pseudo flush, relapse compartments, gross tumor volumes, and highrisk regions have been defined to characterize the heterogeneity. For the majority of pairwise cooccurrences, we found no evidence to assert that observed co-occurrences were significantly different from their expected co-occurrences (Binomial test with False Discovery Rate correction, alpha=0.05). The co-occurrence among terms in the studied papers was found to be driven by their individual prevalence and trends in the literature. CONCLUSION: Combinations of MR imaging biomarkers from morphological, PWI, DWI and CSI exams have demonstrated their capability to predict clinical outcomes in different management moments of gliomas. Whereas morphologic-derived compartments have been mostly studied during the last ten years, new multi-parametric MRI approaches have also been proposed to discover specific subcompartments of the tumors. MR biomarkers from those subcompartments show the local behavior within the heterogeneous tumor and may quantify the prognosis and response to treatment of gliomas.

Title: In vivo MRS measurement of 2-hydroxyglutarate in patient-derived IDH-mutant xenograft mouse models versus glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To generate a preclinical model of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant gliomas from glioma patients and design a MRS method to test the compatibility of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) production between the preclinical model and patients. METHODS: Five patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice were generated from two glioma patients with IDH1 R132H mutation. A PRESS sequence was tailored at 9.4 T, with computer simulation and phantom analyses, for improving 2HG detection in mice. 2HG and other metabolites in the PDX mice were measured using the optimized MRS at 9.4 T and compared with 3 T MRS measurements of the metabolites in the parental-tumor patients. Spectral fitting was performed with LCModel using in-house basis spectra. Metabolite levels were quantified with reference to water. RESULTS: The PRESS TE was optimized to be 96 ms, at which the 2HG 2.25 ppm signal was narrow and inverted, thereby leading to unequivocal separation of the 2HG resonance from adjacent signals from other metabolites. The optimized MRS provided precise detection of 2HG in mice compared to short-TE MRS at 9.4 T. The 2HG estimates in PDX mice were in excellent agreement with the 2HG measurements in the patients. CONCLUSION: The similarity of 2HG production between PDX models and parental-tumor patients indicates that PDX tumors retain the parental IDH metabolic fingerprint and can serve as a preclinical model for improving our understanding of the IDH-mutation associated metabolic reprogramming.

Title: (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of (2)H-to-(1)H exchange quantifies the dynamics of cellular metabolism in vivo.
Abstract: Quantitative mapping of the in vivo dynamics of cellular metabolism via non-invasive imaging contributes to our understanding of the initiation and progression of diseases associated with dysregulated metabolic processes. Current methods for imaging cellular metabolism are limited by low sensitivities, costs or the use of specialized hardware. Here, we introduce a method that captures the turnover of cellular metabolites by quantifying signal reductions in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) resulting from the replacement of (1)H with (2)H. The method, which we termed quantitative exchanged-label turnover MRS, only requires deuterium-labelled glucose and standard magnetic resonance imaging scanners, and with a single acquisition provides steady-state information and metabolic rates for several metabolites. We used the method to monitor glutamate, glutamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and lactate in the brains of unaffected and glioma-bearing rats following the administration of (2)H(2)-labelled glucose and (2)H(3)-labelled acetate. Quantitative exchanged-label turnover MRS should broaden the applications of routine (1)H MRS.

Title: Phytochemical Constituents, Antioxidant, Cytotoxic, and Antimicrobial Activities of the Ethanolic Extract of Mexican Brown Propolis.
Abstract: Propolis is a complex mixture of natural sticky and resinous components produced by honeybees from living plant exudates. Globally, research has been dedicated to studying the biological properties and chemical composition of propolis from various geographical and climatic regions. However, the chemical data and biological properties of Mexican brown propolis are scant. The antioxidant activity of the ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) sample collected in Mexico and the isolated compounds is described. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated in a central nervous system and cervical cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity of EEP was evaluated in a C6 cell line and cervical cancer (HeLa, SiHa, and CasKi) measured by the 3-(3,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. The antibacterial activity was tested using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Twelve known compounds were isolated and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Additionally, forty volatile compounds were identified by means of headspace-solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry time of flight analysis (HS-SPME/GC-MS-TOF). The main volatile compounds detected include nonanal (18.82%), alpha-pinene (12.45%), neryl alcohol (10.13%), and alpha-pinene (8.04%). EEP showed an anti-proliferative effect on glioma cells better than temozolomide, also decreased proliferation and viability in cervical cancer cells, but its effectiveness was lower compared to cisplatin.

Title: Monocarboxylate transporter 1 blockade with AZD3965 inhibits lipid biosynthesis and increases tumour immune cell infiltration.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) is a regulator of cell metabolism and a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Understanding the changes in tumour function accompanying MCT1 inhibition will better characterise the anti-tumour effects of MCT1 inhibitors, potentially enabling the identification of pharmacodynamic biomarkers for the clinical development of these agents. METHODS: We assessed the impact of the MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 on tumour metabolism and immune cell infiltration as key determinants of tumour biological function in the MCT1-dependent Raji B cell lymphoma model. RESULTS: Treatment of Raji xenograft-bearing severe combined immunodeficiency mice with AZD3965 led to inhibition of tumour growth paralleled with a decrease in tumour choline, as detected by non-invasive in vivo proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This effect was attributed to inhibition of phosphocholine de novo synthesis following decreased choline kinase alpha protein and messenger RNA expression that correlated with the AZD3965-induced build-up in intracellular lactate. These changes were concomitant with increased tumour immune cell infiltration involving dendritic and natural killer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new insights into the metabolic and cellular changes that occur in the tumour microenvironment following MCT1 blockade, which may contribute to the anti-tumour activity of AZD3965 and could have potential as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of MCT1 inhibition.

Title: Clinical Imaging for Diagnostic Challenges in the Management of Gliomas: A Review.
Abstract: Neuroimaging plays a critical role in the management of patients with gliomas. While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the standard imaging modality, it is frequently insufficient to inform clinical decision-making. There is a need for noninvasive strategies for reliably distinguishing low-grade from high-grade gliomas, identifying important molecular features of glioma, choosing an appropriate target for biopsy, delineating target area for surgery or radiosurgery, and distinguishing tumor progression (TP) from pseudoprogression (PsP). One recent advance is the identification of the T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch sign on standard MRI to identify isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant astrocytomas. However, to meet other challenges, neuro-oncologists are increasingly turning to advanced imaging modalities. Diffusion-weighted imaging modalities including diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging can be helpful in delineating tumor margins and better visualization of tissue architecture. Perfusion imaging including dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using gadolinium or ferumoxytol contrast agents can be helpful for grading as well as distinguishing TP from PsP. Positron emission tomography is useful for measuring tumor metabolism, which correlates with grade and can distinguish TP/PsP in the right setting. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can identify tissue by its chemical composition, can distinguish TP/PsP, and can identify molecular features like 2-hydroxyglutarate. Finally, amide proton transfer imaging measures intracellular protein content, which can be used to identify tumor grade/progression and distinguish TP/PsP.

Title: A metabolomic data fusion approach to support gliomas grading.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of brain tumors. However, despite the development of MRI techniques, the differential diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) primary pathologies, such as lymphoma and glioblastoma or tumor-like brain lesions and glioma, is often challenging. MRI can be supported by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to enhance its diagnostic power and multiproject-multicenter evaluations of classification of brain tumors have shown that an accuracy around 90% can be achieved for most of the pairwise discrimination problems. However, the survival rate for patients affected by gliomas is still low. The High-Resolution Magic-Angle-Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HR-MAS NMR) metabolomics studies may be helpful for the discrimination of gliomas grades and the development of new strategies for clinical intervention. Here, we propose to use T(2) -filtered, diffusion-filtered and conventional water-presaturated spectra to try to extract as much information as possible, fusing the data gathered by these different NMR experiments and applying a chemometric approach based on Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR). Biomarkers important for glioma's discrimination were found. In particular, we focused our attention on cystathionine (Cyst) that shows promise as a biomarker for the better prognosis of glioma tumors.

Title: Imaging and Tissue Biomarkers of Choline Metabolism in Diffuse Adult Glioma: 18F-Fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and Choline Kinase alpha.
Abstract: The cellular and molecular basis of choline uptake on PET imaging and MRS-visible choline-containing compounds is not well understood. Choline kinase alpha (ChoKalpha) is an enzyme that phosphorylates choline, an essential step in membrane synthesis. We investigate choline metabolism through 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FMC) PET, MRS, and tissue ChoKalpha in human glioma. Fourteen patients with a suspected diffuse glioma underwent multimodal 3T MRI and dynamic 18F-FMC PET/CT prior to surgery. Co-registered PET and MRI data were used to target biopsies to regions of high and low choline signal, and immunohistochemistry for ChoKalpha expression was performed. The 18F-FMC/PET differentiated WHO (World Health Organization) grade IV from grade II and III tumours, whereas MRS differentiated grade III/IV from grade II tumours. Tumoural 18F-FMC/PET uptake was higher than in normal-appearing white matter across all grades and markedly elevated within regions of contrast enhancement. The 18F-FMC/PET correlated weakly with MRS Cho ratios. ChoKalpha expression on IHC was negative or weak in all but one glioblastoma sample, and did not correlate with tumour grade or imaging choline markers. MRS and 18F-FMC/PET provide complimentary information on glioma choline metabolism. Tracer uptake is, however, potentially confounded by blood-brain barrier permeability. ChoKalpha overexpression does not appear to be a common feature in diffuse glioma.

Title: The anatomy and metabolome of the lymphatic system in the brain in health and disease.
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the brain is equipped with a lymphatic drainage system that is actively involved in parenchymal waste clearance, brain homeostasis and immune regulation. However, the exact anatomic drainage routes of brain lymph fluid (BLF) remain elusive, hampering the physiological study and clinical application of this system. In this study, we systematically dissected the anatomy of the BLF pathways in a rat model. Moreover, we developed a protocol to collect BLF from the afferent lymphatic vessels of deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the fourth ventricle. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that BLF contains more metabolites than CSF, suggesting that BLF might be a more sensitive indicator of brain dynamics under physiological and pathological conditions. Finally, we identified several metabolites as potential diagnostic biomarkers for glioma, Parkinson's disease and CNS infectious diseases. Together, these data may provide insight into the physiology of the lymphatic system in the brain and into the clinical diagnosis of CNS disorders.

Title: Temporoinsular Glioma Resection under Awake Mapping: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.
Abstract: Temporoinsular gliomas are frequently large-sized tumors that require meticulous planning to ensure maximum surgical resection and minimal neurologic deficits in patients. Here, we demonstrate our technique encompassing multi-modal imaging guidance and awake brain mapping which enables maximum safe resection of such tumors. The patient, a 39-yr-old man, presented with depression and memory loss for 18 mo. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; MAGNETOM Verio, Siemens) revealed a nonenhancing lesion in the left dominant temporoinsular lobe. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze the choline/N-acetyl-aspartate index which suggested a low-grade glioma diagnosis. Informed patient consent was obtained. After craniotomy, the mouth motor, speech arrest, and word generation areas were mapped via direct cortical stimulation under awake mapping. A strip electrode was placed across the precentral gyrus for continuous motor evoked potential monitoring. Cortical incisions were made in nonfunctional cortical areas and tumor was resected in the temporal lobe. Following this, tumor at the inferior insular zone was carefully debunked with Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (Integra Lifescience) also through the temporal window. The hippocampus was preserved since it was not invaded by tumor. Subcortical mapping combined with Diffuse Tensor Imaging tractography-based navigation (Medtronic lnc.) was performed to localize the motor and language pathways. Intraoperative MRI evaluation showed tumor resection extent of 95%. Pathological and molecular analysis revealed a diagnosis of Grade II IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma. After surgery the patient was administered chemotherapy (Temozolomide). He recovered without language or motor deficits.

Title: In vivo 2-hydroxyglutarate-proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (3 T, PRESS technique) in treatment-naive suspect lower-grade gliomas: feasibility and accuracy in a clinical setting.
Abstract: Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) mutations are often detected in lower-grade gliomas (LGG) and result into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) synthesis. Prior studies showed that 2HG can be detected in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), but its accuracy and translational impact are still under investigation. PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical feasibility of MRS for in vivo detection and quantification of 2HG on consecutive treatment-naive suspect LGG patients and to compare MRS accuracy with tissue IDH1/2 analysis. METHODS: MRS spectra at 3 T were acquired with 1H-MRS single-voxel PRESS 2HG-tailored sequences with TE 30 (group 1) or TE 97 (groups 2A and B). Voxel sizes were 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm(3) for group 1 (n = 13) and group 2A (n = 14) and 2 x 2 x 2 cm(3) for group 2B (n = 32). Multiple metabolites' concentrations were analyzed with LCModel. Tumors were assessed for IDH status and main molecular markers. 2HG levels in urine/blood were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The larger voxel TE 97 sequence resulted in highest specificity (100%), sensitivity (79%), and accuracy (87%). Urine and blood 2HG did not result predictive. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that 2 x 2 x 2-cm(3) voxel TE 97 MRS shows high accuracy for 2HG detection, with good sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing IDH mutant gliomas. Main limits of the technique are small tumor volume and low cellularity. Integrating 2HG-MRS with other metabolites may help non-invasive diagnosis of glioma, prognostic assessment, and treatment planning in clinical setting.

Title: Deep learning in the detection of high-grade glioma recurrence using multiple MRI sequences: A pilot study.
Abstract: The identification of high-grade glioma (HGG) progression may pose a diagnostic dilemma due to similar appearances of treatment-related changes (TRC) (e.g. pseudoprogression or radionecrosis). Deep learning (DL) may be able to assist with this task. MRI scans from consecutive patients with histologically confirmed HGG (grade 3 or 4) were reviewed. Scans for which recurrence or TRC was queried were followed up to determine whether the cases indicated recurrence/progression or TRC. Identified cases were randomly split into training and testing sets (80%/20%). Following development on the training set, classification experiments using convolutional neural networks (CNN) were then conducted using models based on each of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI - isotropic diffusion map), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FLAIR and post-contrast T1 sequences. The sequence that achieved the highest accuracy on the test set was then used to develop DL models in which multiple sequences were combined. MRI scans from 55 patients were included in the study (70.1% progression/recurrence). 54.5% of the randomly allocated test set had progression/recurrence. Based upon DWI sequences the CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.73 (F1 score = 0.67). The model based on the DWI+FLAIR sequences in combination achieved an accuracy of 0.82 (F1 score = 0.86). The results of this study support similar studies that have shown that machine learning, in particular DL, may be useful in distinguishing progression/recurrence from TRC. Further studies examining the accuracy of DL models, including magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), with larger sample sizes may be beneficial.

Title: Role of Neuroimaging Modality in the Assessment of Oxidative Stress in Brain: A Comprehensive Review.
Abstract: BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress (OS) is the secondary source of an injury in consequence to the earlier caused primary injury; it is the condition of an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants within the physiological system. OS causes alterations in proteins and DNA structure, leading to inflammation, apoptotic cell death, and tissue damage. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Glioma-induced neurodegeneration and the normal aging-related neuro-degeneration are primarily associated with the increased OS. The present review article is committed to delivering a comprehensive overview of the current neuroimaging modalities which estimates an indirect correlate of OS in the brain. OS-induced changes in white matter tracts and the gray matter volumes are reviewed assessing the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) respectively. Further, the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to assess the OS-induced alterations of chemical moieties, and thus the resultant structural implications in the neurological disorders are also briefly as well as precisely reviewed. CONCLUSION: In the present review article we present an overview of the role of neuroimaging modalities in the diagnosis, and longitudinal assessment during treatment of the OS induced changes.

Title: A Mistaken Diagnosis of Secondary Glioblastoma as Parasitosis.
Abstract: Background: Glioblastoma is a malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis requiring early diagnosis. Secondary glioblastoma refers to cases that progressed from low-grade glioma. Evidence shows that timely resection correlates with increased survival. Case presentation: We describe a case of a patient with secondary glioblastoma who was mistakenly diagnosed with Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection until 7 years after disease onset. The patient presented with non-specific clinical manifestations at disease onset. A conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the primary survey provided insufficient information, and thus failed to identify the malignancy. During follow-up, unfortunately, clinicians were misled by the patient's raw food diet, a positive serum parasite antibody and a result of low glucose metabolism on Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT). The patient was diagnosed with parasitosis. However, his condition kept getting worse under antiparasitic treatment. Preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) failed to reverse the mistaken impression. Final diagnosis was confirmed until intraoperative and postoperative pathological findings indicated glioblastoma. Conclusion: We ascribe the incorrect diagnosis to insufficient understanding on imaging manifestations of brain neoplasm as well as clinical features of parasitosis. Thus, we review the MRI, FDG-PET-CT, MRS, and DTI data of this case according to the timeline, refer to relevant studies, and point out the pitfalls. With a long course of slowly progressing, this was a rare case of secondary glioblastoma with the absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Assessment of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Status in Gliomas: The New Frontiers of Spectrobiopsy in Neurodiagnostics.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the era of integrated genomic-histologic analysis of brain tumors, new biomarkers have been introduced as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic indicators. The analysis of the mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes IDH1 and IDH2 has provided important diagnostic and prognostic information for patients affected by diffuse glioma (i.e., the presence of the mutation has been related to an increased survival rate). The reference standard of IDH mutation detection has been its assessment in surgical specimens, immunohistochemistry, and/or genetic sequencing. Knowing the IDH status information preoperatively would be of great importance, because it has been related to tumor progression and the response to treatment. The oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), accumulated in gliomas with IDH mutation status, can be detected in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). METHODS: The 2HG-MRS technique remains technically challenging. We have summarized the results of the first pilot study in Australia, which included 10 patients affected by glioma. The data recorded from May 2017 to November 2018 were analyzed. RESULTS: In our exploratory study, we reached a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, confirming the strong predictive role of 2HG, as detected using MRS, in the diagnosis of glioma. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we have focused on methodological tips and future perspectives of the technique in the neuroimaging and neuro-oncological scenario. We would advocate the integration of 2HG-MRS into standard clinical practice.

Title: What Does Reduced FDG Uptake Mean in High-Grade Gliomas?
Abstract: PURPOSE: As well as in many others cancers, FDG uptake is correlated with the degree of malignancy in gliomas, that is, commonly high FDG uptake in high-grade gliomas. However, in clinical practice, it is not uncommon to observe high-grade gliomas with low FDG uptake. Our aim was to explore the tumor metabolism in 2 populations of high-grade gliomas presenting high or low FDG uptake. METHODS: High-resolution magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was realized on tissue samples from 7 high-grade glioma patients with high FDG uptake and 5 high-grade glioma patients with low FDG uptake. Tumor metabolomics was evaluated from 42 quantified metabolites and compared by network analysis. RESULTS: Whether originating from astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, the high-grade gliomas with low FDG avidity represent a subgroup of high-grade gliomas presenting common characteristics: low aspartate, glutamate, and creatine levels, which are probably related to the impaired electron transport chain in mitochondria; high serine/glycine metabolism and so one-carbon metabolism; low glycerophosphocholine-phosphocholine ratio in membrane metabolism, which is associated with tumor aggressiveness; and finally negative MGMT methylation status. CONCLUSIONS: It seems imperative to identify this subgroup of high-grade gliomas with low FDG avidity, which is especially aggressive. Their identification could be important for early detection for a possible personalized treatment, such as antifolate treatment.

Title: Multiple primary central nervous system lymphoma in the elderly: A case report.
Abstract: RATIONALE: Multiple primary central nervous system lymphoma (MPCNSL) is a rare disease with differential diagnosis and treatment. As the underlying pathogenesis is not yet clarified, the early-stage clinical manifestations are occult and atypical. Also, the imaging manifestations are not specific, which is challenging for the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, additional clinical research is essential to understand the etiology of the disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 63-year-old male patient suffered from MPCNSLs but without typical clinical manifestations. The findings of the imaging examination were as follows. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed long T1 and T2 signal shadows in the right frontal lobe, right hippocampus, right cerebellar hemisphere, and the left occipital lobe. In addition, patchy T1-enhanced signal shadows were observed in the right frontal lobe and around the midline. Frontal lesions were detected in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), Cho peak increased, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak decreased. On the other hand, in the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), apparent dispersion coefficient (ADC) showed low-value changes and high signal changes. The positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) displayed radioactive accumulation in the right frontal lobe. DIAGNOSIS: Multiple primary central nervous system lymphoma. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received some conservative medical treatment, but his condition continued to worsen. Finally, he received a pathological biopsy, and refused further treatment after the result was reported. OUTCOMES: The patient died 1 week after biopsy, and the course of disease was about 100 days. LESSONS: PCNSL is a primary intracranial malignancy with low incidence and a high degree of malignancy and specificity in clinical manifestations. To facilitate early clinical treatment and improve the long-term survival of patients, it is necessary to master the imaging diagnostic methods and its features. The comprehensive application of multiple imaging examinations, such as CT, MRI, PET/CT, and PET/MRI, as well as, cerebrospinal fluid cytology can greatly improve the diagnosis of PCNSL.

Title: Genetic Variants Related to Cell Cycle and Stability of Telomere in Patients with Glioma.
Abstract: Background: Glioma, most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, is highly aggressive and associated with a poor prognosis. Evaluate the association of polymorphisms related of to the cell cycle, integrity and DNA repair with gliomas, as well as lifestyle habits, comorbidities, survival and response to treatment. Methods: Were studied 303 individuals distributed into: Study Group - 100 patients with gliomas, regardless of the degree of malignancy, and Control Group - 203 individuals without clinical signs of the disease. These polymorphisms were genotyped by TaqMan(R) SNP Genotyping Assay. Significance level was set at 5%. Results: Smoking, alcohol consumption, systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) prevailed in patients, compared to controls (P=0.0088, P=0.0001, P=0.0001, P=0.0011, respectively). In the logistic regression analysis, alcohol consumption and SAH were identified as independent risk factors for gliomas (P=0.0001, P=0.0027, respectively). Patients with low-grade gliomas showed survival in one year (92.0+/-6.8%), compared to patients with high-grade gliomas (24.0+/-5.3; P=0.011). Conclusion: Polymorphisms involved in cell cycle, telomere protection and stability and DNA repair are not associated with gliomas. On the other hand, alcohol consumption and SAH stand out as independent risk factors for the disease. Low-grade gliomas, response to treatment and the combination of chemotherapy with Temozolomide and radiation therapy show increased survival of patients.

Title: Embedding MRI information into MRSI data source extraction improves brain tumour delineation in animal models.
Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most frequent malignant intra-cranial tumour. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice in diagnosis, aggressiveness assessment, and follow-up. However, there are examples where it lacks diagnostic accuracy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy enables the identification of molecules present in the tissue, providing a precise metabolomic signature. Previous research shows that combining imaging and spectroscopy information results in more accurate outcomes and superior diagnostic value. This study proposes a method to combine them, which builds upon a previous methodology whose main objective is to guide the extraction of sources. To this aim, prior knowledge about class-specific information is integrated into the methodology by setting the metric of a latent variable space where Non-negative Matrix Factorisation is performed. The former methodology, which only used spectroscopy and involved combining spectra from different subjects, was adapted to use selected areas of interest that arise from segmenting the T2-weighted image. Results showed that embedding imaging information into the source extraction (the proposed semi-supervised analysis) improved the quality of the tumour delineation, as compared to those obtained without this information (unsupervised analysis). Both approaches were applied to pre-clinical data, involving thirteen brain tumour-bearing mice, and tested against histopathological data. On results of twenty-eight images, the proposed Semi-Supervised Source Extraction (SSSE) method greatly outperformed the unsupervised one, as well as an alternative semi-supervised approach from the literature, with differences being statistically significant. SSSE has proven successful in the delineation of the tumour, while bringing benefits such as 1) not constricting the metabolomic-based prediction to the image-segmented area, 2) ability to deal with signal-to-noise issues, 3) opportunity to answer specific questions by allowing researchers/radiologists define areas of interest that guide the source extraction, 4) creation of an intra-subject model and avoiding contamination from inter-subject overlaps, and 5) extraction of meaningful, good-quality sources that adds interpretability, conferring validation and better understanding of each case.

Title: Central Nervous System Opportunistic Infections.
Abstract: Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system are classically associated with immunosuppression arising from infection with human immunodeficiency virus and with various hematologic malignancies. However, over the past few years, they are increasingly associated with transplantation and various immunosuppressive treatments used to treat autoimmune diseases. They cause significant morbidity and mortality and remain a diagnostic challenge due to the absence of typical signs and symptoms of infection and mimicry by various noninfectious causes. The pathogens associated with these infections are often commonly found pathogens of low virulence in immunocompetent hosts and include various bacteria, parasites, fungi, or viruses. These infections can present as various clinical syndromes, including meningitis, encephalitis, space-occupying lesions, stroke-like presentations, or even neoplastic manifestations. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can be seen in patients with multiple sclerosis on various new immunomodulatory drugs in addition to patients with human immunodeficiency virus, transplantation, or hematologic malignancies, and is characterized by multifocal white matter lesions. Human herpesvirus-6 causes severe encephalitis in transplant recipients, known as posttransplantation acute limbic encephalitis. Neoplastic manifestations like Epstein-Barr virus-associated primary central nervous system lymphoma and posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders are particularly challenging to diagnose and manage. Modern diagnostic techniques, including advanced imaging techniques like magnetic resonance spectroscopy, use of polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic sequencing, can be helpful in early recognition of pathogens. Treatment of most of these involves lowering of immunosuppression when possible and use of specific antimicrobial agents when available. Improved outcomes can be seen when early diagnosis is made.

Title: PI3K/mTOR inhibition of IDH1 mutant glioma leads to reduced 2HG production that is associated with increased survival.
Abstract: 70-90% of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas are characterized by mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDHmut). IDHmut produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which drives tumorigenesis in these tumors. The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway represents an attractive therapeutic target for IDHmut gliomas, but noninvasive indicators of drug target modulation are lacking. The goal of this study was therefore to identify magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable metabolic biomarkers associated with IDHmut glioma response to the dual PI3K/(mTOR) inhibitor XL765. (1)H-MRS of two cell lines genetically modified to express IDHmut showed that XL765 induced a significant reduction in several intracellular metabolites including 2HG. Importantly, examination of an orthotopic IDHmut tumor model showed that enhanced animal survival following XL765 treatment was associated with a significant in vivo (1)H-MRS detectable reduction in 2HG but not with significant inhibition in tumor growth. Further validation is required, but our results indicate that 2HG could serve as a potential noninvasive MRS-detectable metabolic biomarker of IDHmut glioma response to PI3K/mTOR inhibition.

Title: The pH sensitivity of APT-CEST using phosphorus spectroscopy as a reference method.
Abstract: The pH value is a potential physiological marker for clinical diagnosis as it is altered in pathologies such as tumors. While intracellular pH can be measured noninvasively via phosphorus spectroscopy ((31) P MRSI), Amide Proton Transfer-Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (APT-CEST) MRI has been suggested as an alternative method for pH quantification. To assess the suitability of APT-CEST contrast for pH quantification, two approaches (magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry [MTR(asym) ] and Lorentzian difference analysis [LDA]) for analyzing the Z-spectrum have been correlated with pH values obtained by (31) P MRSI. Fourteen patients with glioblastoma and 12 healthy controls were included. In contrast to MTR(asym) , the LDA is modeling the direct water saturation and the semi-solid magnetization transfer, allowing a separate evaluation of the aliphatic nuclear Overhauser effect and the APT-CEST. The results of our study show that the pH values obtained by (31) P MRSI correspond well with both methods describing the APT-CEST contrast. Two-sample t-test showed significant differences in MTR(asym) , LDA and pH obtained by (31) P MRSI for regions of interest in glioblastoma, contralateral control areas and normal appearing white matter (P < 0.001). A slightly improved correlation between the amide signal and pH was found after performing LDA (r = 0.78) compared with MTR(asym) (r = 0.70). While both methods can be used to monitor pH changes, the LDA approach appears to be better suited.

Title: Herpes Simplex Encephalitis Initially Erroneously Diagnosed as Glioma of the Cerebellum: Case Report and Literature Review.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex encephalitis caused by herpes simplex has an estimated annual prevalence in the order of 1 in 250,000 to 500,000 patients and is considered to be the most usually encountered nonendemic pathogenic cause of lethal encephalitis in well-developed countries. There are a few cases reported in the literature in which a diagnostic dilemma between was raised between herpes simplex encephalitis and brain glioma and a definitive diagnosis was difficult to obtain. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 5-year-old girl with a previous medical history of premature thelarche. As a part of her investigation, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed, which revealed a space-occupying lesion of the posterior fossa. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed, which advocated for the diagnosis of glioma. She was operated on, but the histopathologic analysis failed to verify the imaging findings. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans illustrated the progression of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of data regarding CSF sample analysis, electroencephalography, brain biopsy, and imaging findings, along with the progression of the clinical picture of our patient, verified the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. When confronted with confounding data that can pose a diagnostic dilemma between HSV encephalitis and glioma, brain biopsy and polymerase chain reaction of CSF samples could be able to verify the definitive diagnosis. When interpreting our results, we always have to consider the evolution of the clinical picture.

Title: Clinical and Radiographic Features for Differentiating Solitary Fibrous Tumor/Hemangiopericytoma From Meningioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma (SFT/HPC) and meningioma exhibit similar radiographic features; however, they differ in their prognoses. Preoperative differentiation between them is important for determining the treatment and follow-up plan. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that can be used to differentiate SFT/HPC from meningioma and World Health Organization (WHO) grade I from grade II meningioma. METHODS: The analysis included 84 cases: 5 of SFT/HPC, 72 of WHO grade I meningioma, and 7 of WHO grade II meningioma. Clinical characteristics and conventional magnetic resonance imaging, perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) LCModel parameters were evaluated via multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the factors that distinguish SFT/HPC from meningioma. RESULTS: Patients with SFT/HPC were mostly men and were younger than those with meningioma. The percentage of T2-weighted images in meningioma was greater than that in SFT/HPC. There were significant differences between SFT/HPC and meningioma in levels of glutamate, phosphocholine, myo-inositol, or glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine derived from long echo-time MRS, and myo-inositol derived from short echo-time MRS. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the age of <45 years and myo-inositol in short echo-time MRS of >==6.347 were associated with a diagnosis of SFT/HPC with high sensitivity and specificity. However, no factors were found that differentiated WHO grade I meningioma from WHO grade II meningioma. CONCLUSIONS: Age and myo-inositol level calculated from MRS are useful factors for distinguishing SFT/HPC from meningioma preoperatively.

Title: Multimodal MRI characteristics of the glioblastoma infiltration beyond contrast enhancement.
Abstract: Our inability to identify the invasive margin of glioblastomas hampers attempts to achieve local control. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been implemented clinically to delineate the margin of the tumor infiltration, its derived anisotropic (q) values can extend beyond the contrast-enhanced area and correlates closely with the tumor. However, its correlation with tumor infiltration shown on multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy(1) (MRS) and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be investigated. In this study, we aimed to show tissue characteristics of the q-defined peritumoral invasion on MRS and perfusion MRI. Patients with a primary glioblastoma were included (n = 51). Four regions of interest were analyzed; the contrast-enhanced lesion, peritumoral abnormal q region, peritumoral normal q region, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. MRS, including choline (Cho)/creatinine (Cr), Cho/N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and NAA/Cr ratios, and the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were analyzed. Our results showed an increase in the Cho/NAA (p = 0.0346) and Cho/Cr (p = 0.0219) ratios in the peritumoral abnormal q region, suggestive of tumor invasion. The rCBV was marginally elevated (p = 0.0798). Furthermore, the size of the abnormal q regions was correlated with survival; patients with larger abnormal q regions showed better progression-free survival (median 287 versus 53 days, p = 0.001) and overall survival (median 464 versus 274 days, p = 0.006) than those with smaller peritumoral abnormal q regions of interest. These results support how the DTI q abnormal area identifies tumor activity beyond the contrast-enhanced area, especially correlating with MRS.

Title: Multiparametric MRI in differentiating solitary brain metastasis from high-grade glioma: diagnostic value of the combined use of diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the combined use of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging (DSCI) parameters could provide a more accurate diagnosis in the differentiation of high-grade glioma (HGG) from solitary brain metastasis (SBM) in the enhancing tumour and in the peritumoural region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients who received DWI, DSCI, and MRS before surgery were assessed. In differentiating SBM from HGG, the cutoff values of the DWI-apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin, ADCmax, and ADCmean), DSCI-relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), and MRS-Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/Cr parameters for the peritumoural region were determined with ROC. The combined ROC curve was used for the different combinations of the peritumoural region DWI, DSCI, and MRS parameters in differentiating between the two tumours, and the best model combination was formed. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at our institutes. RESULTS: In the enhancing tumour, all the parameters except NAA/Cr (P = 0.024) exhibited no statistical difference in differentiating between these two groups (P > 0.05). AUC values for ADCmin, ADCmax, ADCmean, rADCmin, rADCmax, rADCmean, rCBV, Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/Cr parameters in the peritumoural region in differentiating SBM from HGG were 0.860, 0.822, 0.848, 0.822, 0.801, 0.822, 0.906, 0.851, 0.903, and 0.784, respectively. In differentiating HGG from SBM, the best model consisted of the combination of peritumoural ADCmin, rCBV, and Cho/NAA parameters. AUC values were 0.970. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of peritumoural region ADCmin, rCBV, and Cho/NAA parameters can help in differentiating SBM from HGG, with a diagnostic accuracy of 97%.

Title: Assessment of (213)Bi-anti-EGFR MAb treatment efficacy in malignant cancer cells with [1-(13)C]pyruvate and [(18)F]FDG.
Abstract: Evaluation of response to therapy is among the key objectives of oncology. A new method to evaluate this response includes magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with hyperpolarized (13)C-labelled metabolites, which holds promise to provide new insights in terms of both therapeutic efficacy and tumor cell metabolism. Human EJ28Luc urothelial carcinoma and LN18 glioma cells were treated with lethal activity concentrations of a (213)Bi-anti-EGFR immunoconjugate. Treatment efficacy was controlled via analysis of DNA double-strand breaks (immunofluorescence gammaH2AX staining) and clonogenic survival of cells. To investigate changes in metabolism of treated cells vs controls we analyzed conversion of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate to [1-(13)C]lactate via MRS as well as viability of cells, lactate formation and lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cellular supernatants and [(18)F]FDG uptake in treated cells vs controls, respectively. Treatment of malignant cancer cells with (213)Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb induced intense DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in cell death as monitored via clonogenic survival. Moreover, treatment of EJ28Luc bladder cancer cells resulted in decreased cell viability, [(18)F]FDG-uptake and an increased lactate export. In both EJ28Luc and LN18 carcinoma cells treatment with (213)Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb triggered a significant increase in lactate/pyruvate ratios, as measured with hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate. Treatment with (213)Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb resulted in an effective induction of cell death in EJ28Luc and LN18 cells. Lactate/pyruvate ratios of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate proved to detect early treatment response effects, holding promise for future clinical applications in early therapy monitoring.

Title: Lipid Fraction Derived From MRI In- and Opposed-Phase Sequence as a Novel Biomarker for Predicting Survival Outcome of Glioma.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND PURPOSE: Our study evaluated the capability of magnetic resonance imaging in- and opposed-phase (IOP) derived lipid fraction as a novel prognostic biomarker of survival outcome in glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 46 histologically proven glioma (WHO grades II-IV) patients using standard 3T magnetic resonance imaging brain tumor protocol and IOP sequence. Lipid fraction was derived from the IOP sequence signal-loss ratio. The lipid fraction of solid nonenhancing region of glioma was analyzed, using a three-group analysis approach based on volume under surface of receiver-operating characteristics to stratify the prognostic factors into three groups of low, medium, and high lipid fraction. The survival outcome was evaluated, using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression model. RESULTS: Significant differences were seen between the three groups (low, medium, and high lipid fraction groups) stratified by the optimal cut-off point for overall survival (OS) (p </= 0.01) and time to progression (p </= 0.01) for solid nonenhancing region. The group with high lipid fraction had five times higher risk of poor survival and earlier time to progression compared to the low lipid fraction group. The OS plot stratified by lipid fraction also had a strong correlation with OS plot stratified by WHO grade (R = 0.61, p < 0.01), implying association to underlying histopathological changes. CONCLUSION: The lipid fraction of solid nonenhancing region showed potential for prognostication of glioma. This method will be a useful adjunct in imaging protocol for treatment stratification and as a prognostic tool in glioma patients.

Title: Diagnosis and Treatment of Early-Stage Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Early-stage glioblastoma has few identifiable findings; clinical significance of its early diagnosis and treatment remains unclear as no report has described treatment and long-term follow-up for early-stage glioblastoma. Here, we report a case of a 69-year-old woman with early-stage glioblastoma treated by microsurgical resection and chemoradiotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a small high-intensity lesion in the right temporal lobe on T2-weighted imaging. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI revealed ring enhancement. On magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the lesion demonstrated increased choline and reduced N-acetyl-aspartate levels compared with the normal brain. Positron emission tomography with (11)C-methionine (MET) revealed (11)C-methionine uptake in the lesion. Microsurgical resection was performed, and glioblastoma was pathologically diagnosed. The patient was treated with local radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy postoperatively. Eight years postoperatively, the patient is surviving without tumor recurrence, but progressive cognitive impairment developed 6 years' postoperatively. Aggressive treatment of early-stage glioblastoma may improve its extremely poor prognosis. Conversely, cognitive impairment may become a significant medical and social problem when effective therapies for glioblastoma are developed.

Title: Assessment of Overall Survival in Glioma Patients as Predicted by Metabolomic Criteria.
Abstract: Objective: We assess the efficacy of the metabolomic profile from glioma biopsies in providing estimates of postsurgical Overall Survival in glioma patients. Methods: Tumor biopsies from 46 patients bearing gliomas, obtained neurosurgically in the period 1992-1998, were analyzed by high resolution (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR- (1)H MRS), following retrospectively individual postsurgical Overall Survival up to 720 weeks. Results: The Overall Survival profile could be resolved in three groups; Short (shorter than 52 weeks, n = 19), Intermediate (between 53 and 364 weeks, n = 19) or Long (longer than 365 weeks, n = 8), respectively. Classical histopathological analysis assigned WHO grades II-IV to every biopsy but notably, some patients with low grade glioma depicted unexpectedly Short Overall Survival, while some patients with high grade glioma, presented unpredictably Long Overall Survival. To explore the reasons underlying these different responses, we analyzed HR-(1)H MRS spectra from acid extracts of the same biopsies, to characterize the metabolite patterns associated to OS predictions. Poor prognosis was found in biopsies with higher contents of alanine, acetate, glutamate, total choline, phosphorylcholine, and glycine, while more favorable prognosis was achieved in biopsies with larger contents of total creatine, glycerol-phosphorylcholine, and myo-inositol. We then implemented a multivariate analysis to identify hierarchically the influence of metabolomic biomarkers on OS predictions, using a Classification Regression Tree (CRT) approach. The CRT based in metabolomic biomarkers grew up to three branches and split into eight nodes, predicting correctly the outcome of 94.7% of the patients in the Short Overall Survival group, 78.9% of the patients in the Intermediate Overall Survival group, and 75% of the patients in the Long Overall Survival group, respectively. Conclusion: Present results indicate that metabolic profiling by HR-(1)H MRS improves the Overall Survival predictions derived exclusively from classical histopathological gradings, thus favoring more precise therapeutic decisions.

Title: Combination of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and (1)(1)C-Methionine Positron Emission Tomography for the Accurate Diagnosis of Non-Enhancing Supratentorial Glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the combination of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and (1)(1)C-methionine positron emission tomography ((1)(1)C-MET PET) could increase accurate diagnostic sensitivity for non-enhancing supratentorial gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2012 and December 2017, 109 patients with non-enhanced supratentorial lesions on contrast-enhanced MRI were enrolled. Each patient underwent MRS and (1)(1)C-MET PET before treatment. A lesion was considered to be a glioma when either the MRS or (1)(1)C-MET PET results reached the diagnostic threshold. The radiological diagnosis was compared with the pathological diagnosis or medical diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity were 60.0% and 50.0% for MRS and 75.8% and 50.0% for (1)(1)C-MET PET, respectively. Upon combining the two modalities, the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging-based diagnosis prior to surgery reached 89.5% and 42.9%, respectively. Statistically significant differences in the sensitivities were observed between the combined and individual approaches (MRS alone, 89.5% vs. 60.0%, p < 0.001; (1)(1)C-MET PET alone, 89.5% vs. 75.8%, p = 0.001). However, no significant differences in specificity were observed between the combined and individual modalities. CONCLUSION: The combination of MRS and (1)(1)C-MET PET findings significantly increases accurate diagnostic sensitivity for non-enhancing supratentorial gliomas without significantly lowering the specificity. This finding suggests the potential of the combined MRS and (1)(1)C-MET PET approach in clinical applications.

Title: Lack of choline elevation on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in grade I-III gliomas.
Abstract: Elevated levels of choline are generally emphasized as marker of increased cellularity and cell membrane turnover in gliomas. In this study, we investigated the incidence rate of lack of choline/creatine and choline/water elevation in a population of grade I-III gliomas. A cohort of 41 patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas underwent multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 3 T magnetic resonance system prior to treatment. Peak areas for choline and myoinositol were measured from all voxels that exhibited hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and were normalized to creatine and unsuppressed water from each voxel. The average metabolite/creatine and metabolite/water ratios from these voxels were then computed. Similarly, average metabolite ratios were computed from normal brain parenchyma. Gliomas were considered for lack of choline elevation when choline/creatine and choline/water ratios from neoplastic regions were less than those from normal brain parenchyma regions. Six of 41 (14.6%) grade I-III gliomas showed lack of elevation for choline/creatine and choline/water ratios compared to normal brain parenchyma. Four of these six gliomas also demonstrated elevated levels of myoinositol/creatine ratio. All other gliomas (n = 35) had elevated choline levels from neoplastic regions relative to normal parenchyma. The sensitivity of choline/creatine or choline/water in determining a grade I-III glioma was 85.4%. These findings suggest that a lack of choline/creatine or choline/water elevation may be seen in some gliomas and low choline levels should not prevent us from considering the possibility of a grade I-III glioma.

Title: A quantitative SVM approach potentially improves the accuracy of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the preoperative evaluation of the grades of diffuse gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) metabolic features and the grade of gliomas, and to establish a machine-learning model to predict the glioma grade. METHODS: This study included 112 glioma patients who were divided into the training (n = 74) and validation (n = 38) sets based on the time of hospitalization. Twenty-six metabolic features were extracted from the preoperative (1)H-MRS image. The Student's t-test was conducted to screen for differentially expressed features between low- and high-grade gliomas (WHO grades II and III/IV, respectively). Next, the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm was performed to further select features for a support vector machine (SVM) classifier building. Performance of the predictive model was evaluated both in the training and validation sets using ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Among the extracted (1)H-MRS metabolic features, thirteen features were differentially expressed. Four features were further selected as grade-predictive imaging signatures using the mRMR algorithm. The predictive performance of the machine-learning model measured by the AUC was 0.825 and 0.820 in the training and validation sets, respectively. This was better than the predictive performances of individual metabolic features, the best of which was 0.812. CONCLUSIONS: (1)H-MRS metabolic features could help in predicting the grade of gliomas. The machine-learning model achieved a better prediction performance in grading gliomas than individual features, indicating that it could complement the traditionally used metabolic features.

Title: Advanced MR imaging and (18)F-DOPA PET characteristics of H3K27M-mutant and wild-type pediatric diffuse midline gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate MRI-derived diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), (1)H-MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging in comparison with (18)F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) PET with respect to diagnostic evaluation of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) H3K27M-mutant and wild-type. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 22 pediatric patients with DMG histologically proved and molecularly classified as H3K27M-mutant (12 subjects) and wild-type (10 subjects) who underwent DWI, (1)H-MRS, and ASL performed within 2 weeks of (18)F-DOPA PET. DWI-derived relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC min), (1)H-MRS data [choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA), choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), and presence of lactate] and relative ASL-derived cerebral blood flow max (rCBF max) were compared with (18)F-DOPA uptake Tumor/Normal tissue (T/N) and Tumor/Striatum (T/S) ratios, and correlated with histological and molecular features of DMG. Statistics included Pearson's chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman's rank correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The highest degrees of correlation among different techniques were found between T/S, rADC min and Cho/NAA ratio (p < 0.01), and between rCBF max and rADC min (p < 0.01). Significant differences between histologically classified low- and high-grade DMG, independently of H3K27M-mutation, were found among all imaging techniques (p </= 0.02). Significant differences in terms of rCBF max, rADC min, Cho/NAA and (18)F-DOPA uptake were also found between molecularly classified mutant and wild-type DMG (p </= 0.02), even though wild-type DMG included low-grade astrocytomas, not present among mutant DMG. When comparing only histologically defined high-grade mutant and wild-type DMG, only the (18)F-DOPA PET data T/S demonstrated statistically significant differences independently of histology (p < 0.003). ROC analysis demonstrated that T/S ratio was the best parameter for differentiating mutant from wild-type DMG (AUC 0.94, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced MRI and (18)F-DOPA PET characteristics of DMG depend on histological features; however, (18)F-DOPA PET-T/S was the only parameter able to discriminate H3K27M-mutant from wild-type DMG independently of histology.

Title: Characterizing tumor invasiveness of glioblastoma using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize the abnormalities revealed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using MR spectroscopy (MRS) and perfusion imaging, and to evaluate the prognostic value of a proposed quantitative measure of tumor invasiveness by combining contrast-enhancing (CE) and DTI abnormalities in patients with glioblastoma. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with glioblastoma were recruited preoperatively. DTI was decomposed into isotropic (p) and anisotropic (q) components. The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was calculated from the dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging. Values of N-acetylaspartate, myoinositol, choline (Cho), lactate (Lac), and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) were measured from multivoxel MRS and normalized as ratios to creatine (Cr). Tumor regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from the CE T1-weighted (CE-ROI) and DTI-q (q-ROI) maps. Perfusion and metabolic characteristics of these ROIs were measured and compared. The relative invasiveness coefficient (RIC) was calculated as a ratio of the characteristic radii of CE-ROI and q-ROI. The prognostic significance of RIC was tested using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The Cho/Cr, Lac/Cr, and Glx/Cr in q-ROI were significantly higher than CE-ROI (p = 0.004, p = 0.005, and p = 0.007, respectively). CE-ROI had significantly higher rCBV values than q-ROI (p < 0.001). A higher RIC was associated with worse survival in a multivariate overall survival (OS) model (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.85, p = 0.016) and progression-free survival (PFS) model (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.16-2.07, p = 0.003). An RIC cutoff value of 0.89 significantly predicted shorter OS (median 384 vs 605 days, p = 0.002) and PFS (median 244 vs 406 days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DTI-q abnormalities displayed higher tumor load and hypoxic signatures compared with CE abnormalities, whereas CE regions potentially represented the tumor proliferation edge. Integrating the extents of invasion visualized by DTI-q and CE images into clinical practice may lead to improved treatment efficacy.

Title: Comparison of L-Methyl-11C-Methionine PET With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Detecting Newly Diagnosed Glioma.
Abstract: AIMS: Amino acid PET and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are at the forefront of noninvasive imaging techniques used for detection and subtyping of glioma-suspicious lesions. In this pilot study, we compare L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS for their ability to predict glioma subtypes. METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically, confirmed newly diagnosed glioma underwent preoperative L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS in 1 diagnostic session. According to the molecular portfolio and histopathologic diagnosis, patients were subdivided in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma, IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma, IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion, and with 1p/19q codeletion subgroups. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), creatine, choline, and N-acetyl aspartate peaks were correlated with postoperative histopathologic tumor diagnoses. RESULTS: Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio was highest in glioblastoma patients (4.18) followed by patients with IDH wild-type grade II and III glioma (3.41). The latter TBRmax values were higher compared with those in patients with IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion (1.95) and in patients with IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted grade II and III glioma (2.79). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy marker distribution showed no clear trend. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed TBRmax to be the best performing parameter in identifying IDH status (area under the curve, 0.67) and all spectroscopy markers combined in identifying glioma subgroups (area under the curve, 0.68), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: L-Methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS bear limited potential in glioma subgrouping. L-Methyl-C-methionine PET appears to be superior in differentiating IDH status, whereas MRS is more helpful in glioma subgrouping.

Title: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to Identify Metabolite Biomarkers of Nonresponsiveness to Targeted Therapy in Glioblastoma Tumor Stem Cells.
Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant brain tumor, and current therapies confer only modest survival benefits. A major obstacle is our ability to monitor treatment effect on tumors. Current imaging modalities are ambiguous, and repeated biopsies are not encouraged. To scout for markers of treatment response, we used NMR spectroscopy to study the effects of a survivin inhibitor on the metabolome of primary glioblastoma cancer stem cells. Applying high resolution NMR spectroscopy ((1)H resonance frequency: 800.03 MHz) to just 3 million cells per sample, we achieved sensitive and high resolving determinations of, e.g., amino acids, nucleosides, and constituents of the citric acid cycle. For control samples that were cultured, prepared, and measured at varying dates, peak area relative standard deviations were 15-20%. Analyses of unfractionated lysates were performed for straightforward compound identification with COLMAR and HMDB databases. Principal component analysis revealed that citrate levels were clearly upregulated in nonresponsive cells, while lactate levels substantially decreased following treatment for both responsive and nonresponsive cells. Hence, lactate and citrate may be potential markers of successful drug uptake and poor response to survivin inhibitors, respectively. Our metabolomics approach provided alternative biomarker candidates compared to spectrometry-based proteomics, underlining benefits of complementary methodologies. These initial findings make a foundation for exploring in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) of brain tumors, as citrate and lactate are MRS-visible. In sum, NMR metabolomics is a tool for addressing glioblastoma.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for Differentiating Between Enhanced Gliomas and Malignant Lymphomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although the treatment strategies for malignant lymphomas and gliomas differ, it is usually difficult to preoperatively distinguish between them. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was recently reported to be useful for preoperative diagnoses; however, MRS data analysis using LCModel, which is a quantitative and objective method, was performed in only a few of the existing reports. METHODS: The clinical characteristics, conventional magnetic resonance imaging findings, and MRS parameters using LCModel were evaluated to identify the factors that can help distinguish between malignant lymphomas and enhanced gliomas. RESULTS: In total, 59 cases were evaluated, including 13 cases of malignant lymphoma, 1 case of pilocytic astrocytoma, 5 cases of grade Ⅱ glioma, 5 cases of grade Ⅲ glioma, and 35 cases of glioblastoma. There was no correlation between clinical characteristics (sex and age) and diagnosis. Neither T1- nor T2-weighted image was useful for differentiation between the 2 forms of tumors, but the apparent diffusion coefficient minimum value was useful for distinguishing malignant lymphomas from gliomas, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.852. MRS analysis using LCModel revealed differences in glutamate (Glu), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), Glu + glutamine, and Lipid (Lip) 13a + Lip13b between malignant lymphomas and gliomas. The largest AUC was 0.904, which was obtained for the Glu level, followed by 0.883 and 0.866 for NAA + NAAG and Lip13a + Lip13b, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of proton-MRS using LCModel is considered to be a valuable method for distinguishing between gliomas and malignant lymphomas.

Title: Metabolic Detection of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition in Mantle Cell Lymphoma Cells.
Abstract: Current methods to evaluate effects of kinase inhibitors in cancer are suboptimal. Analysis of changes in cancer metabolism in response to the inhibitors creates an opportunity for better understanding of the interplay between cell signaling and metabolism and, from the translational perspective, potential early evaluation of response to the inhibitors as well as treatment optimization. We performed genomic, metabolomic, and fluxomic analyses to evaluate the mechanism of action of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib (IBR) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. Our comprehensive analysis of the data generated by these diverse technologies revealed that IBR profoundly affected key metabolic pathways in IBR-sensitive cells including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis while having much less effects on IBR-poorly responsive cells. Changes in (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable lactate and alanine concentrations emerged as promising biomarkers of response and resistance to IBR as demonstrated from experiments on various MCL cell lines. The metabolic network analysis on the (13)C MRS and (13)C LC/MS experimental data provided quantitative estimates of various intracellular fluxes and energy contributions. Glutaminolysis contributed over 50% of mitochondrial ATP production. Administration of the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 induced growth suppression of the IBR-poorly responsive cells. IMPLICATIONS: Our study demonstrates application of the advanced metabolomic/fluxomic techniques for comprehensive, precise, and prompt evaluations of the effects of kinase inhibition in MCL cells and has strong translational implications by potentially permitting early evaluation of cancer patient response versus resistance to kinase inhibitors and on design of novel therapies for overcoming the resistance.

Title: Phase I/IIa study of concomitant radiotherapy with olaparib and temozolomide in unresectable or partially resectable glioblastoma: OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 trial protocol.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer. The aim of this study is to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM. METHODS: The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to 70 years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6 weeks and as single agent for 4 weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers, the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to 79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in the phase IIa. DISCUSSION: Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as radiosensitizer. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03212742 , registered June, 7, 2017.

Title: Glutamate weighted imaging contrast in gliomas with 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Diffuse gliomas are incurable malignancies, which undergo inevitable progression and are associated with seizure in 50-90% of cases. Glutamate has the potential to be an important glioma biomarker of survival and local epileptogenicity if it can be accurately quantified noninvasively. METHODS: We applied the glutamate-weighted imaging method GluCEST (glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer) and single voxel MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) at 7 Telsa (7 T) to patients with gliomas. GluCEST contrast and MRS metabolite concentrations were quantified within the tumour region and peritumoural rim. Clinical variables of tumour aggressiveness (prior adjuvant therapy and previous radiological progression) and epilepsy (any prior seizures, seizure in last month and drug refractory epilepsy) were correlated with respective glutamate concentrations. Images were separated into post-hoc determined patterns and clinical variables were compared across patterns. RESULTS: Ten adult patients with a histo-molecular (n = 9) or radiological (n = 1) diagnosis of grade II-III diffuse glioma were recruited, 40.3 +/- 12.3 years. Increased tumour GluCEST contrast was associated with prior adjuvant therapy (p = .001), and increased peritumoural GluCEST contrast was associated with both recent seizures (p = .038) and drug refractory epilepsy (p = .029). We distinguished two unique GluCEST contrast patterns with distinct clinical and radiological features. MRS glutamate correlated with GluCEST contrast within the peritumoural voxel (R = 0.89, p = .003) and a positive trend existed in the tumour voxel (R = 0.65, p = .113). CONCLUSION: This study supports the role of glutamate in diffuse glioma biology. It further implicates elevated peritumoural glutamate in epileptogenesis and altered tumour glutamate homeostasis in glioma aggressiveness. Given the ability to non-invasively visualise and quantify glutamate, our findings raise the prospect of 7 T GluCEST selecting patients for individualised therapies directed at the glutamate pathway. Larger studies with prospective follow-up are required.

Title: A Noninvasive Comparison Study between Human Gliomas with IDH1 and IDH2 Mutations by MR Spectroscopy.
Abstract: The oncogenes that are expressed in gliomas reprogram particular pathways of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1/2) in diffuse gliomas are associated with abnormally high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels. The aim of this study was to determine whether metabolic reprogramming associated with IDH mutant gliomas leads to additional (1)H MRS-detectable differences between IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and to identify metabolites correlated with 2-HG. A total of 21 glioma patients (age= 37 +/- 11, 13 males) were recruited for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using semi-localization by adiabatic selective refocusing pulse sequence at an ultra-high-field (7T). For 20 patients, the tumor mutation subtype was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing. LCModel analysis was applied for metabolite quantification. A two-sample t-test was used for metabolite comparisons between IDH1 (n = 15) and IDH2 (n = 5) mutant gliomas. The Pearson correlation coefficients between 2-HG and associated metabolites were calculated. A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparison. IDH2 mutant gliomas have a higher level of 2-HG/tCho (total choline=phosphocholine+glycerylphosphorylcholine) (2.48 +/- 1.01vs.0.72 +/- 0.38, P(c) < 0.001) and myo-Inositol/tCho (2.70 +/- 0.90 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.51, P(c) = 0.011) compared to IDH1 mutation gliomas. Associated metabolites, myo-Inositol and glucose+taurine were correlated with 2-HG levels. These results show the improved characterization of the metabolic pathways in IDH1 and IDH2 gliomas for precision medicine.

Title: Investigation of dacomitinib on reducing cell necrosis and enhancing cell apoptosis in C6 glioma rat model by MRI.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glioma is one of the most epidemic and obstinate types of cancer in the central nervous system (CNS) with poor survival rate. Dacomitinib inhibited cell viability and proliferation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-amplified glioma. In the present study, the regional effects of Dacomitinib on tumor necrosis was investigated. METHODS: A C6 rat glioma model was evaluated using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and morphological T2-weighted imaging (T2W). The effects of Dacomitinib on glioma cells were investigated using methods of immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. RESULTS: The obtained data indicated that metabolite ratios were significantly decreased (all P<0.05) in the Dacomitinib-treated group compared with C6 glioma control group. The ADC value of necrotic core in Dacomitinib group was significantly lower than that in control group. In addition, the expression of Ki-67 in Dacomitinib-treated group (50.32 +/- 5.61) was significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05). The apoptotic index (AI) (28.01 +/- 2.37) in Dacomitinib-treated group was significantly higher than that in control group (11.58 +/- 3.17). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the Dacomitinib could suppress glioma cell necrosis and proliferation.

Title: Recent developments and future directions in adult lower-grade gliomas: Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) consensus.
Abstract: The finding that most grades II and III gliomas harbor isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations conveying a relatively favorable and fairly similar prognosis in both tumor grades highlights that these tumors represent a fundamentally different entity from IDH wild-type gliomas exemplified in most glioblastoma. Herein we review the most recent developments in molecular neuropathology leading to reclassification of these tumors based upon IDH and 1p/19q status, as well as the potential roles of methylation profiling and deletional analysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A and 2B. We discuss the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, benefit of surgical resection, and neuroimaging features of lower-grade gliomas as they relate to molecular subtype, including advanced imaging techniques such as 2-hydroxyglutarate magnetic resonance spectroscopy and amino acid PET scanning. Recent, ongoing, and planned studies of radiation therapy and both cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapies are summarized, including both small molecule and immunotherapy approaches specifically targeting the mutant IDH protein.

Title: Cystathionine as a marker for 1p/19q codeleted gliomas by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) highly benefits diagnosis and prognosis in gliomas. In this study, we investigated the effect of 1p/19q codeletion on cancer cell metabolism and evaluated possible metabolic targets for tailored therapies. METHODS: We combined in vivo 1H (proton) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements in human gliomas with the analysis of a series of standard amino acids by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) in human glioma biopsies. Sixty-five subjects with low-grade glioma were included in the study: 31 underwent the MRI/MRS examination, 47 brain tumor tissue samples were analyzed with LC-MS, and 33 samples were analyzed for gene expression with quantitative PCR. Additionally, we performed metabolic tracer experiments in cell models with 1p deletion. RESULTS: We report the first in vivo detection of cystathionine by MRS in 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. Selective accumulation of cystathionine was observed in codeleted gliomas in vivo, in brain tissue samples, as well as in cells harboring heterozygous deletions for serine- and cystathionine-pathway genes located on 1p: phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH). Quantitative PCR analyses showed 40-50% lower expression of both PHGDH and CTH in 1p/19q codeleted gliomas compared with their non-codeleted counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide strong evidence of a selective vulnerability of codeleted gliomas to serine and glutathione depletion and point to cystathionine as a possible noninvasive marker of treatment response.

Title: Combined Amino Acid Positron Emission Tomography and Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Glioma Patients.
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide valuable information about brain tumor patients. Particularly amino acid PET, advanced MRI techniques, and combinations thereof are of great interest for the non-invasive assessment of biological characteristics in patients with primary or secondary brain cancer. A methodological innovation that potentially advances research in patients with brain tumors is the increasing availability of hybrid PET/MRI systems, which enables the simultaneous acquisition of both imaging modalities. Furthermore, the advent of ultra-high field MRI scanners operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 T or more will allow further development of metabolic MR imaging at higher resolution. This review focuses on the combination of amino acid PET with MR spectroscopic imaging, perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging, as well as chemical exchange saturation transfer in patients with high-grade gliomas, especially glioblastomas.

Title: MRI as a diagnostic biomarker for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioblastoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative differentiation of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma is clinically crucial because the treatment strategies differ substantially. PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI for differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma. STUDY TYPE: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SUBJECTS: Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to find relevant original articles up to November 25, 2018. The search term combined synonyms for "lymphoma," "glioblastoma," and "MRI." FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Patients underwent at least one MRI sequence including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging (DSC), dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE), arterial spin labeling (ASL), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using 1.5 or 3 T. ASSESSMENT: Quality assessment was performed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. STATISTICAL TESTS: Hierarchical logistic regression modeling was used to obtain pooled sensitivity and specificity. Meta-regression was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with 1182 patients were included. MRI sequences demonstrated high overall diagnostic performance with pooled sensitivity of 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87-93%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI, 85-93%). The area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94). Studies using DSC or ASL showed high diagnostic performance (sensitivity of 93% [95% CI, 89-97%] and specificity of 91% [95% CI, 86-96%]). Heterogeneity was only detected in specificity (I(2) = 66.84%) and magnetic field strength was revealed to be a significant factor affecting study heterogeneity. DATA CONCLUSION: MRI showed overall high diagnostic performance for differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma, with studies using DSC or ASL showing high diagnostic performance. Therefore, MRI sequences including DSC or ASL is a potential diagnostic tool for differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn. Reson.

Title: Tissue-type mapping of gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To develop a statistical method of combining multimodal MRI (mMRI) of adult glial brain tumours to generate tissue heterogeneity maps that indicate tumour grade and infiltration margins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of mMRI from patients with histological diagnosis of glioma (n = 25). (1)H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) was used to label regions of "pure" low- or high-grade tumour across image types. Normal brain and oedema characteristics were defined from healthy controls (n = 10) and brain metastasis patients (n = 10) respectively. Probability density distributions (PDD) for each tissue type were extracted from intensity normalised proton density and T(2)-weighted images, and p and q diffusion maps. Superpixel segmentation and Bayesian inference was used to produce whole-brain tissue-type maps. RESULTS: Total lesion volumes derived automatically from tissue-type maps correlated with those from manual delineation (p < 0.001, r = 0.87). Large high-grade volumes were determined in all grade III & IV (n = 16) tumours, in grade II gemistocytic rich astrocytomas (n = 3) and one astrocytoma with a histological diagnosis of grade II. For patients with known outcome (n = 20), patients with survival time < 2 years (3 grade II, 2 grade III and 10 grade IV) had a high-grade volume significantly greater than zero (Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.0001) and also significantly greater high grade volume than the 5 grade II patients with survival >2 years (Mann Witney p = 0.0001). Regions classified from mMRI as oedema had non-tumour-like (1)H MRS characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: (1)H MRSI can label tumour tissue types to enable development of a mMRI tissue type mapping algorithm, with potential to aid management of patients with glial tumours.

Title: Radiation Necrosis, Pseudoprogression, Pseudoresponse, and Tumor Recurrence: Imaging Challenges for the Evaluation of Treated Gliomas.
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant type of brain neoplasm in adults and carries a dismal prognosis. The current standard of care for GBM is surgical excision followed by radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide-based chemotherapy (TMZ) by six additional cycles. In addition, antiangiogenic therapy with an antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent has been used for recurrent glioblastoma. Over the last years, new posttreatment entities such as pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse have been recognized, apart from radiation necrosis. This review article focuses on the role of different imaging techniques such as conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE-MRI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSE-MRI) perfusion, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and PET/SPECT in differentiation of such treatment-related changes from tumor recurrence.

Title: The Radiological Imaging Features of Easily Misdiagnosed Epithelioid Glioblastoma in Seven Patients.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We review the radiological imaging features and report histopathological findings of 7 adult patients with epithelioid glioblastoma (eGBM), which was a newly revised subtype of glioblastoma. METHODS: Seven adult patients with a diagnosis of eGBM on a brain tissue specimen were retrospectively confirmed by pathology. The tumor magnetic resonance imaging characteristics such as location, number, edema, necrosis, hemorrhage, enhancement, diffusion-weighted image, apparent diffusion coefficient, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, dynamic susceptibility contrast-perfusion-weighted imaging, and histopathological findings were documented. RESULTS: The tumors of these patients exhibited iso-hyperintensive signal on the T2-weighted image and iso-hypointensive signal on the T1-weighted image. All the lesions manifested iso-hypointensive signal on the diffusion-weighted image, and 2 cases showed significantly restricted hyperintensive signal (2/7). Peritumoral edema in all cases was mild. Five cases were located in the cortical lobe (5/7) and the other 2 were multifocal (2/7). Four cases showed white matter collapse sign (4/7). These tumors revealed apparent enhancement after contrast injection. In particular, 4 cases displayed capsuled sign (4/7), 2 cases showed dura mater tail sign (2/7), and 1 case showed hemorrhage (1/7). The mean value of apparent diffusion coefficient in 6 cases was 1.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The mean value of relative cerebral blood volume in 3 cases was 2.84 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s on dynamic susceptibility contrast-perfusion-weighted imaging. The average value of the choline/N-acetyl aspartate ratio in 4 cases was 6.47 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All cases expressed a BRAF V600E mutation according to molecular characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: eGBMs that were predominantly located in cortex with mild peritumoral edema, white matter collapse, encapsular sign, and dura mater tail sign could be easily misdiagnosed as cortex-involved intracranial brain tumor such as meningioma, whereas multifocal tumors could be easily misdiagnosed as metastatic tumor and lymphoma. Multimodal images were helpful for the differential diagnosis.

Title: Multivoxel (1)H-MR Spectroscopy Biometrics for Preoprerative Differentiation Between Brain Tumors.
Abstract: We investigated multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) biometrics for preoperative differentiation and prognosis of patients with brain metastases (MET), low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). In total, 33 patients (HGG, 14; LGG, 9; and 10 MET) were included. (1)H-MRS imaging (MRSI) data were assessed and neurochemical profiles for metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) + NAAG(NAA), Cr + PCr(total creatine, tCr), Glu + Gln(Glx), lactate (Lac), myo-inositol(Ins), GPC + PCho(total choline, tCho), and total lipids, and macromolecule (tMM) signals were estimated. Metabolites were reported as absolute concentrations or ratios to tCho or tCr levels. Voxels of interest in an MRSI matrix were labeled according to tissue. Logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Across HGG, LGG, and MET, average Ins/tCho was shown to be prognostic for overall survival (OS): low values (</=1.29) in affected hemisphere predicting worse OS than high values (>1.29), (log rank < 0.007). Lip/tCho and Ins/tCho combined showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for both HGG/LGG (P < .001) and LGG/MET (P < .001) measured in nonenhancing/contrast-enhancing lesional tissue. Combining tCr/tCho in perilesional edema with tCho/tCr and NAA/tCho from ipsilateral normal- appearing tissue yielded 100% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity (P < .002) for HGG/MET. Best single biomarker: Ins/tCho for HGG/LGG and total lipid/tCho for LGG/MET showed 100% sensitivity and 75% and 100% specificity, respectively. HGG/MET; NAA/tCho showed 75% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity. Multivoxel 1H-MRSI provides prognostic information for OS for HGG/LGG/MET and a multibiometric approach for differentiation may equal or outperform single biometrics.

Title: Imaging features (CT, MRI, MRS, and PET/CT) of primary central nervous system lymphoma in immunocompetent patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Because of the low incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) in non-HIV individuals and because of the lack of specific clinical manifestations and auxiliary examinations, the disease is easily missed or misdiagnosed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the imaging features of PCNSL in non-HIV patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with PCNSL treated between January 2001 and December 2011 at the Naval General Hospital (Beijing, China). All included patients were pathologically diagnosed with PCNSL. Specimens were obtained by stereotactic biopsy and diagnosed by pathological examination. Serological panel had to be negative for HIV. RESULTS: Out of the 118 patients, 73 (61.9%) were male and 45 (38.1%) were female. Median age was 54 (range 11-83) years. All patients had B cell lymphoma. The lesions showed slightly hyperintense shadows on computed tomography (CT) images, and mostly hyperintense T1 and iso- or hyperintense T2 signals on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most lesions showed patchy enhancement after enhanced scanning, and some had the characteristic "butterfly sign" on enhanced MRI. The magnetic resonance spectroscopy of PCNSL manifested as increased Cho peak, moderately decreased NAA peak, and slightly decreased Cr peak. Positron emission computed tomography indicated high metabolism of (18)F-FDG in PCNSL lesions. CONCLUSION: MRI is important in the diagnosis of PCNSL. Understanding the imaging features of PCNSL will help improve its diagnosis in clinics.

Title: Carbon Nitride Dots: A Selective Bioimaging Nanomaterial.
Abstract: In contrast to the recent immense attention in carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs) as a heteroatom-doped carbon quantum dot (CQD), their biomedical applications have not been thoroughly investigated. Targeted cancer therapy is a prominently researched area in the biomedical field. Here, the ability of CNQDs as a selective bioimaging nanomaterial was investigated to assist targeted cancer therapy. CNQDs were first synthesized using four different precursor sets involving urea derivatives, and the characteristics were compared to select the best candidate material for bioapplications. Characterization techniques such as UV-vis, luminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used. These CNQDs were analyzed in in vitro studies of bioimaging and labeling using pediatric glioma cells (SJGBM2) for possible selective biolabeling and nanodistribution inside the cell membrane. The in vitro cellular studies were conducted under long-wavelength emission without the interference of blue autofluorescence. Thus, excitation-dependent emission of CNQDs was proved to be advantageous. Importantly, CNQDs selectively entered SJGBM2 tumor cells, while it did not disperse into normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). The distribution studies in the cell cytoplasm indicated that CNQDs dispersed into lysosomes within approximately 6 h after the incubation. The CNQDs exhibited great potential as a possible nanomaterial in selective bioimaging and drug delivery for targeted cancer therapy.

Title: Awake Transcortical Approach Resection of Dominant Posterior Cingulate Gyrus Glioma: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.
Abstract: Two techniques, the translongitudinal cerebral fissure and transfrontal cortical approach, can be employed to resect posterior cingulate gyrus tumors. We demonstrate the transcortical technique comprising of multimodal imaging guidance and awake brain mapping which enabled maximum safe resection of dominant cingulate gyrus glioma.  The patient, a 49-yr-old female, came to clinic after experiencing headache for a month. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a nonenhancing lesion of the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze the choline/N-acetyl-aspartate index (CNI) which strongly suggested a low-grade glioma diagnosis.  In surgery, after creating a tailed bone window and dural opening, strip electrode was placed across the central sulcus for continuous motor evoked potential monitoring. Next, direct cortical stimulation was done to map functional cortical areas. The transcortical approach was chosen at this point because many veins hindered hemisphere retraction. Noneloquent cortical incisions were made and the tumor was carefully debunked with a cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. The corpus callosum marked the deep end of dissection. Subcortical mapping combined with diffusion tensor imaging tractography-based navigation was performed to localize motor and language tracks. Intraoperative MRI evaluation confirmed a gross total resection. Pathological and molecular analysis revealed a World Health Organization Grade II IDH-wildtype Diffuse Astrocytoma diagnosis. Since the patient falls in high-risk group, she was also administered radiation and chemotherapy. Long-term cognitive evaluation follow-up of the patient showed she had good functional recovery with no obvious long-term deficits.  Informed patient consent was obtained.

Title: A novel infram deletion in MSH6 gene in glioma: Conversation on MSH6 mutations in brain tumors.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Histological and molecular information and biopsy help in the diagnosis of the type and grade of tumors and increase the value of estimation of the biological behavior of tumors. In this study, we focused on a consanguineous Iranian Family with high prevalence of brain tumors in their pedigree and reviewed the literature on MSH6 mutations in brain tumors and the treatment responses focused on Gliomas. METHOD: We chose a family with a high prevalence of brain tumor in their pedigree. We studied the proband's neuroimaging and brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biopsy result, and whole-genome sequencing. RESULT: The neuroimaging and brain proton MRS reported a lesion in the right frontoparietal. The MRI revealed a large enhancible heterogenous mass in the right temporo-fronto-parieto-occipital lobes with involvement of corpus callosum which was suggestive of glioma. The patient revealed a homozygous pattern for a novel 9 base-pare deletion at the 912-914 codon on exon 4 of the MSH6 gene. DISCUSSION: We discuss several studies on MSH6 mutations in brain tumors and we discuss treatment responses in MSH6 mutations and the studies conducted to sensitize chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance brain tumors to face this subject efficiently. CONCLUSION: Patients should be evaluated for MMR mutation before chemo and radiotherapy, and it is valuable to follow-up these mutations during the treatment too. In temozolomide (TMZ)-resitance cases, it is suggested to use complementary strategies such as using HDACis and a combination of a STAT3 Inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor, BER inhibition mechanism, and PARP-1 inhibitor.

Title: Multimodality fMRI with perfusion, diffusion-weighted MRI and (1) H-MRS in the diagnosis of lympho-associated benign and malignant lesions of the parotid gland.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) and tumor-like benign lymphoepithelial lesion (BLEL) in the parotid gland is difficult. PURPOSE: To distinguish MALToma and BLEL with multimodality MRI including hydrogenproton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI-MR), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MR), and evaluate each sequence. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: Twenty-five patients with parotid tumor-like BLEL and 20 with parotid MALToma. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5-T/T(1) WI, T(2) WI, single-voxel (1) H-MRS, DWI-MR, and DCE-MR. ASSESSMENT: All MR images were interpreted and agreed upon by two radiologists who were blinded to clinical information and histopathologic results. The imaging diagnoses were then compared to the histopathologic results. STATISTICAL TESTS: Youden index was used to determine the optimized threshold value. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of different functional (f)MRI methods. RESULTS: Fisher's exact test indicated a significant difference between the (1) H-MRS images of the two lesions (P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of positive choline (Cho) peak in (1) H-MRS of parotid MALToma were 80%, 76%, and 77.7%, respectively. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was 0.992 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s in patients with parotid tumor-like BLEL and 0.634 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s in patients with parotid MALToma, and the difference was statistically significant (t-test, P < 0.001). Choosing the Youden index as 0.669 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the assay were 78.9%, 95.8%, and 88.4%, respectively. Assuming that time-intensity curve (TIC) type I indicated parotid MALToma (positive), and type II and type III indicated parotid tumor-like BLEL (negative), the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of time-to-peak (TTP) and initial slope of increase (ISI) in diagnosing MALToma were 94.1%, 95.2%, and 94.7%, respectively. Combining methods of TTP, ADC, and Cho peak reached the highest AUC (1.000). DATA CONCLUSION: Combined use (1) H-MRS, DWI-MR, and DCE-MR increased the accuracy of the differential diagnosis between these lesions to 100%. Cho peak in (1) H-MRS, ADC less than 0.669 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s, TIC type I together indicated parotid MALToma. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;49:423-432.

Title: Assessment of Primary Brain Lymphoma Using Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The primary lymphoma of the central nervous system is a cancer rare. The diagnosis of this tumoral entity must be considered as an emergency considering the therapeutical involved. Therefore, we report this entity while reporting diagnostic challenges. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Unfortunately, the conventional clinical and imaging signs can be confusing and might contribute to delay the diagnosis process of potentially curable pathological entity. The diagnosis confirmation in immunocompetent patients is based on a stereotaxic biopsy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In this paper, we report a case illustrating the contribution of multimodal imaging including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor MRI, perfusion MRI, and proton MR spectroscopy to the diagnostic approach of the atypical primary lymphoma of the central nervous system.

Title: Preoperative grading of intracranial meningioma by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).
Abstract: Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a common method for the evaluation of intracranial meningiomas, controversy exists regarding which parameter of 1H-MRS best predicts the histopathological grade of an intracranial meningioma. In this study, we evaluated the results of pre-operative 1H-MRS to identify predictive factors for high-grade intracranial meningioma. Thirteen patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II-III meningioma (confirmed by pathology) were defined as high-grade; twenty-two patients with WHO grade I meningioma were defined as low-grade. All patients were evaluated by 1H-MRS before surgery. The relationships between the ratios of metabolites (N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine [Cr], and choline [Cho]) and the diagnosis of high-grade meningioma were analyzed. According to Mann-Whitney U test analysis, the Cho/NAA ratio in cases of high-grade meningioma was significantly higher than in cases of low-grade meningioma (6.34 +/- 7.90 vs. 1.58 +/- 0.77, p<0.05); however, there were no differences in age, Cho/Cr, or NAA/Cr. According to conditional inference tree analysis, the optimal cut-off point for the Cho/NAA ration between high-grade and low-grade meningioma was 2.409 (sensitivity = 61.54%; specificity = 86.36%). This analysis of pre-operative 1H-MRS metabolite ratio demonstrated that the Cho/NAA ratio may provide a simple and practical predictive value for high-grade intracranial meningiomas, and may aid neurosurgeons in efforts to design an appropriate surgical plan and treatment strategy before surgery.

Title: Altered function of the glutamate-aspartate transporter GLAST, a potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma.
Abstract: In glioma patients, high levels of glutamate can cause brain edema and seizures. GLAST, a glutamate-aspartate transporter expressed by astrocytes with a role in glutamate uptake, is highly expressed on the plasma membrane of glioblastoma (GBM) cells, and its expression significantly correlates with shortened patient survival. Here, it was demonstrated that inhibition of GLAST expression limited the progression and invasion of GBM xenografts. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure glutamate in GLAST-expressing gliomas showing that these tumors exhibit increased glutamate concentration compared to GLAST-depleted glioma. Despite their GLAST expression, GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) released rather than taking up glutamate due to their lack of Na+/K+-ATPase. Overexpression of Na+/K+-ATPase in these cells restored glutamate uptake and induced apoptosis. The therapeutic relevance of targeting GLAST in gliomas was assessed using the inhibitor UCPH-101. In glioma-bearing mice, a single intratumoral injection of UCPH-101 significantly increased survival by decreasing GLAST expression and inducing apoptosis. Thus, GLAST has a novel role in GBM that appears to have crucial relevance in glutamate trafficking and may thus be a new therapeutic target.

Title: Methotrexate-induced Leukoencephalopathy without Typical Restricted Diffusion on Diffusion-weighted Imaging and the Utility of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to Support the Diagnosis.
Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is a common antimetabolite agent that is widely used today in treating leukemia, lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. Its use has been associated with leukoencephalopathy causing seizures, paralysis, and even coma. To achieve the best possible outcome, it is important to be able to make a prompt diagnosis. Studies reported restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) which is a reliable early sign of acute MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy. However, we report here the first case of MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy without typical restricted diffusion on DWI and the utility magnetic resonance spectroscopy to support this diagnosis in the difficult case such as the one being presented here.

Title: Current and future tools for determination and monitoring of isocitrate dehydrogenase status in gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hotspot mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (R132) or 2 (R172) genes affect 40% of diffuse gliomas, mostly grades II and III. The mutant enzyme produces high quantities of d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), which reshapes the epigenetic of the cell leading to gliomagenesis. For the clinician, the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is a major biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive consequences. With the development of specific inhibitors and vaccination, it appears also a potential actionable target. RECENT FINDINGS: IDH status is routinely determined on tumor sample by sequencing and immunohistochemistry detecting the most common mutant protein (IDH1R132H). Recently noninvasive diagnostic approaches have been developed based on the detection of the mutant DNA or the D2HG in body fluids, and the detection of D2HG by magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain. SUMMARY: These new techniques open avenues for non invasive diagnostic of glioma in patients not amenable to biopsy, in the preoperative setting and also duringpatients follow-up for evaluation of treatment response and prediction of recurrence.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy differentiates tumefactive demyelinating lesions from gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is often difficult to accurately differentiate tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs) from gliomas using MRI. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in differentiating TDLs from gliomas. METHODS: Cohort 1 included 6 patients with TDLs and 5 with gliomas (3 high-grade), as assessed using a 1.5T MR unit. Cohort 2 included 6 patients with TDLs and 17 patients with gliomas (8 high-grade), as assessed using a 3.0T MR unit. Single-voxel proton MRS was performed to compare the following metabolite area ratios: choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr, and Cho/NAA in both cohorts. Correlations between the target-to-normal-tissue ratio (TNR) obtained using methionine-positron emission tomography (MET-PET) and each MRS metabolite ratio were examined in a subset of cohort 2 (4 patients with TDLs and 11 with gliomas). RESULTS: Mean Cho/NAA ratio was significantly higher in gliomas than in TDLs or MS in cohort 1 (p < 0.05). Mean Cho/NAA ratio was significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in TDLs in both cohorts (p(s) < 0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, high-grade glioma rather than TDL was indicated when the Cho/NAA ratio was >1.72 (the area under the curve was 0.958, and the maximum sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 87%, respectively). A significant positive correlation was observed between Cho/NAA ratio and the MET-PET TNR (r(2 )= 0.35, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MRS effectively differentiates TDLs from high-grade gliomas. Therefore, the clinical use of MRS is likely to enhance patient outcomes.

Title: Exogenous Amino Acid-Loaded Nanovehicles: Stepping across Endogenous Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows the assessment of metabolic contents and biochemical information in vivo. It provides essential compositional information in the diagnosis and monitoring of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, especially brain tumors. Conventional MRS is usually confined to endogenous metabolites that may lack specificity for certain disease such as differentiating glioma from other tumor and non-tumorous lesions. Therefore, exogenous MRS contrast agents (CAs) that may improve the sensitivity and specificity of MRS are highly desirable for its clinical use. In this work, a novel MRS CA, beta-alanine loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres, with a high biosafety profile and characteristic MRS spectrum was synthesized and investigated. This new CA is further tested to realize the accurate functional MRS diagnosis of brain glioma with high sensitivity. The general approach of synthesizing disease specific CA for MRS may lead to a new era of molecular imaging.

Title: Imaging biomarkers guided anti-angiogenic therapy for malignant gliomas.
Abstract: Antiangiogenic therapy is a universal approach to the treatment of malignant gliomas but fails to prolong the overall survival of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma patients. Imaging biomarkers are quantitative imaging parameters capable of objectively describing biological processes, pathological changes and treatment responses in some situations and have been utilized for outcome predictions of malignant gliomas in anti-angiogenic therapy. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques (including perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging), positron emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are imaging techniques that can be used to acquire imaging biomarkers, including the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), K(trans), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Imaging indicators for a better prognosis when treating malignant gliomas with antiangiogenic therapy include the following: a lower pre- or post-treatment rCBV, less change in rCBV during treatment, a lower pre-treatment K(trans), a higher vascular normalization index during treatment, less change in arterio-venous overlap during treatment, lower pre-treatment ADC values for the lower peak, smaller ADC volume changes during treatment, and metabolic changes in glucose and phenylalanine. The investigation and utilization of these imaging markers may confront challenges, but may also promote further development of anti-angiogenic therapy. Despite considerable evidence, future prospective studies are critically needed to consolidate the current data and identify novel biomarkers.

Title: 2-Hydroxyglutarate MR spectroscopy for prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant glioma: a systemic review and meta-analysis using individual patient data.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Noninvasive and accurate modality to predict isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant glioma may have great potential in routine clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for prediction of IDH mutant glioma and provide an optimal cutoff value for 2HG. METHODS: A systematic literature search of Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify original articles investigating the diagnostic performance of 2HG MRS up to March 20, 2018. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explain heterogeneity effects. An optimal cutoff value for 2HG was calculated from studies providing individual patient data. RESULTS: Fourteen original articles with 460 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for the diagnostic performance of 2HG MRS for prediction of IDH mutant glioma were 95% (95% CI, 85-98%) and 91% (95% CI, 83-96%), respectively. The Higgins I2 statistic demonstrated that heterogeneity was present in the sensitivity (I2 = 50.69%), but not in the specificity (I2 = 30.37%). In the meta-regression, echo time (TE) was associated with study heterogeneity. Among the studies using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS), a long TE (97 ms) resulted in higher sensitivity (92%) and specificity (97%) than a short TE (30-35 ms; sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 88%; P < 0.01). The optimal 2HG cutoff value of 2HG using individual patient data was 1.76 mM. CONCLUSION: 2HG MRS demonstrated excellent specificity for prediction of IDH mutant glioma, with TE being associated with heterogeneity in the sensitivity. KEY POINTS: 1. HG MRS has excellent diagnostic performance in the prediction of IDH mutant glioma. 2. The pooled sensitivity was 95% and the pooled specificity was 91%. 3. Echo time was associated with study heterogeneity in the meta-regression.

Title: Neuroradiological features of lymphomatosis cerebri: A systematic review of the English literature with a new case report.
Abstract: Lymphomatosis cerebri is a rare form of diffusely infiltrating primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL). The neuroradiological findings of lymphomatosis cerebri have not been adequately characterized, as the relevant literature consists only of case reports and small case series. The present study describes an unusual presentation of lymphomatosis cerebri in a 56-year-old immunocompetent woman who presented with diffusely infiltrating lesions with perivascular curvilinear enhancement on initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multiple nodules on the later follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. A systematic review of the literature is also performed searching PubMed between January 1996 and December 2016 to collect all pertinent case reports and series written in the English language with pathologically confirmed lymphomatosis cerebri and diffuse infiltrative PCNSL without cohesive masses on initial MRI. A total of 45 cases were identified from 39 articles and the present case report. The patient ages ranged from 28 to 85 years (mean, 57.3 years). Only 3 patients (6.7%) were immunosuppressed (acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients). The most common clinical presentation was cognitive changes or dementia (46.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in all cases was non-specific. Diffuse and asymmetric abnormal T2-hyperintensity in deep and subcortical white matter was observed in all cases. Gray matter involvement (17.8%), spreading along the corticospinal tract (35.6%) and a slight mass effect (51.1%) also were observed. Contrast-enhanced patterns on MRI could be divided into three forms of non-enhancement (64.4%) and non-mass-like enhancement (35.6%) on initial MRI, as well as nodular or mass-like enhancement on the later follow-up MRI (15.6%). There were non-specific findings on magnetic resonance spectroscopy for 4 patients, on positron emission tomography/CT for 12 patients and on single-photon emission CT for 1 patient. Diagnosis was established by brain biopsy in 35 cases (77.8%) and autopsy in 9 cases (20%), involving B-cell lymphoma in 40 cases (88.9%) and T-cell lymphoma in 4 cases (8.9%). In conclusion, lymphomatosis cerebri, namely diffuse PCNSL or diffuse lymphoma of the CNS, is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia in the elderly, diffusely infiltrated CNS white matter along the corticospinal tract, possible involvement of the gray matter, a slight mass effect and varied contrast-enhancement patterns on MRI. Non-enhancement or non-mass-like enhancement on MRI may be a special form of diffuse PCNL during disease development and progression.

Title: Imaging prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation in patients with glioma: a systemic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the imaging features of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant glioma and to assess the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prediction of IDH mutation in patients with glioma. METHODS: A systematic search of Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 10 October 2017 was conducted to find relevant studies. The search terms combined synonyms for 'glioma', 'IDH mutation' and 'MRI'. Studies evaluating the imaging features of IDH mutant glioma and the diagnostic performance of MRI for prediction of IDH mutation in patients with glioma were selected. The pooled summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. The results of multiple subgroup analyses are reported. RESULTS: Twenty-eight original articles in a total of 2,146 patients with glioma were included. IDH mutant glioma showed frontal lobe predominance, less contrast enhancement, well-defined border, high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and low relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) value. For the meta-analysis that included 18 original articles, the summary sensitivity was 86% (95% CI, 79%-91%) and the summary specificity was 87% (95% CI, 78-92%). In a subgroup analysis, the summary sensitivity of 2-hydroxyglutarate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) [96% (95% CI, 91-100%)] was higher than the summary sensitivities of other imaging modalities. CONCLUSIONS: IDH mutant glioma consistently demonstrated less aggressive imaging features than IDH wild-type glioma. Despite the variety of different MRI techniques used, MRI showed the potential to non-invasively predict IDH mutation in patients with glioma. 2-Hydroxyglutarate MRS shows higher pooled sensitivity than other imaging modalities. KEY POINTS: * IDH mutant glioma showed frontal lobe predominance, less contrast enhancement, well-defined border, high ADC value, and low rCBV value. * The diagnostic performance of MRI for prediction of IDH mutation in patients with glioma is within a clinically acceptable range, the summary sensitivity was 86% (95% CI, 79-91%) and the summary specificity was 87% (95% CI, 78-92%). * In a subgroup analysis, the summary sensitivity of 2-hydroxyglutarate MRS [96% (95% CI, 91-100%)] was higher than the summary sensitivities of other imaging modalities.

Title: Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-mutated human gliomas depend on lactate and glutamate to alleviate metabolic stress.
Abstract: Diffuse gliomas often carry point mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH1(mut)), resulting in metabolic stress. Although IDH(mut) gliomas are difficult to culture in vitro, they thrive in the brain via diffuse infiltration, suggesting brain-specific tumor-stroma interactions that can compensate for IDH-1 deficits. To elucidate the metabolic adjustments in clinical IDH(mut) gliomas that contribute to their malignancy, we applied a recently developed method of targeted quantitative RNA next-generation sequencing to 66 clinical gliomas and relevant orthotopic glioma xenografts, with and without the endogenous IDH-1(R132H) mutation. Datasets were analyzed in R using Manhattan plots to calculate distance between expression profiles, Ward's method to perform unsupervised agglomerative clustering, and the Mann Whitney U test and Fisher's exact tests for supervised group analyses. The significance of transcriptome data was investigated by protein analysis, in situ enzymatic activity mapping, and in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy of orthotopic IDH1(mut)- and IDH(wt)-glioma xenografts. Gene set enrichment analyses of clinical IDH1(mut) gliomas strongly suggest a role for catabolism of lactate and the neurotransmitter glutamate, whereas, in IDH(wt) gliomas, processing of glucose and glutamine are the predominant metabolic pathways. Further evidence of the differential metabolic activity in these cancers comes from in situ enzymatic mapping studies and preclinical in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging. Our data support an evolutionary model in which IDH(mut) glioma cells exist in symbiosis with supportive neuronal cells and astrocytes as suppliers of glutamate and lactate, possibly explaining the diffuse nature of these cancers. The dependency on glutamate and lactate opens the way for novel approaches in the treatment of IDH(mut) gliomas.-Lenting, K., Khurshed, M., Peeters, T. H., van den Heuvel, C. N. A. M., van Lith, S.

Title: Application of MRS- and ASL-guided navigation for biopsy of intracranial tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of a tumor depends on accurate identification of the target area for biopsy. However, tumor heterogeneity and the inability of conventional structural data for identifying the most malignant areas can reduce this accuracy. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and practicality of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)- and arterial spin labeling (ASL)-guided MRI navigation for needle biopsy of intracranial tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients with intracranial tumors who underwent intraoperative stereotactic biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. Contrast-enhanced 3D-BRAVO or 3D-T2FLAIR structural data, combined with MRS and ASL data, were used to identify the target area for biopsy. High-choline or high-perfusion sites were chosen preferentially, and then the puncture trajectory was optimized to obtain specimens for histopathologic examination. RESULTS: Twenty-two specimens were collected from 20 glioma patients (two specimens each were collected from two patients) and ten specimens were collected from ten lymphoma patients. The diagnosis rate after the biopsy was 93.3% (28/30). Two gliomas were initially diagnosed as gliosis and subsequently diagnosed correctly after the collection of a second biopsy specimen. Combined MRS and ASL helped target selection in 23 cases (76.7%), including three cases each of low-enhancing and non-enhancing gliomas. In two cases, the target selection decision was changed because the areas initially chosen on the basis of positron emission tomography data did not match the high-perfusion areas identified with ASL. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional MRI, combined MRS and ASL improved the accuracy of target selection for the stereotactic biopsy of intracranial tumors.

Title: ACRIN 6684: Multicenter, phase II assessment of tumor hypoxia in newly diagnosed glioblastoma using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: A multi-center imaging trial by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) "A Multicenter, phase II assessment of tumor hypoxia in glioblastoma using 18F Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) with PET and MRI (ACRIN 6684)", was conducted to assess hypoxia in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). The aims of this study were to support the role of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) as a prognostic marker for brain tumor patients in multi-center clinical trials. Seventeen participants from four sites had analyzable 3D MRSI datasets acquired on Philips, GE or Siemens scanners at either 1.5T or 3T. MRSI data were analyzed using LCModel to quantify metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and lactate (Lac). Receiver operating characteristic curves for NAA/Cho, Cho/Cr, lactate/Cr, and lactate/NAA were constructed for overall survival at 1-year (OS-1) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6). The OS-1 for the 17 evaluable patients was 59% (10/17). Receiver operating characteristic analyses found the NAA/Cho in tumor (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.00) and in peritumoral regions (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) were predictive for survival at 1 year. PFS-6 was 65% (11/17). Neither NAA/Cho nor Cho/Cr was effective in predicting 6-month progression free survival. Lac/Cr in tumor was a significant negative predictor of PFS-6, indicating that higher lactate/Cr levels are associated with poorer outcome. (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.54 to 1.00). In conclusion, despite the small sample size in the setting of a multi-center trial comprising different vendors, field strengths, and varying levels of expertise at data acquisition, MRS markers NAA/Cho, Lac/Cr and Lac/NAA predicted overall survival at 1 year and 6-month progression free survival. This study validates that MRSI may be useful in evaluating the prognosis in glioblastoma and should be considered for incorporating into multi-center clinical trials.

Title: Correlation analysis of expressions of PTEN and p53 with the value obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and apparent diffusion coefficient in the tumor and the tumor-adjacent area in magnetic resonance imaging for glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the correlation of the expression levels of phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and p53 of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with the value obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the tumor and the tumor-adjacent area in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: A total of 38 patients were operated for GBM. All the patients had received diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and MRS prior to surgery. ADC of water molecules and values of metabolite indexes of MRS, including n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr), were recorded, and the ratios of Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr were calculated. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was done to examine the morphology of tumor and of tumor-adjacent tissues; immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine the expressions of PTEN and p53 in the tumor and the tumor-adjacent area. Finally, the correlations of the expressions of PTEN and p53 with ADC, Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr of the tumor and the tumor-adjacent area were analyzed. RESULTS: H&E staining showed that GBM tissues had disordered morphology, different sizes of cells, large cell nuclei and significant cell heterogeneity. IHC indicated that the expression level of p53 protein in the tumor was significantly higher than in the tumor-adjacent tissues (p<0.05). The expression level of PTEN protein was high in the tumor-adjacent tissues, but significantly deficient in the tumor. DWI showed that the signal of DWI in the tumor was significantly increased, but ADC was decreased compared with the tumor-adjacent area. MRS indicated that the wave band of Cho in the tumor was significantly increased, NAA was significantly lowered, and Cr section was decreased compared with the tumor-adjacent area, while NAA/Cr in the tumor was significantly decreased compared with the tumoradjacent area (p<0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that PTEN levels in the tumor and the tumor-adjacent area were positively correlated with ADC in the corresponding area, while p53 in the tumor and the tumor-adjacent area was negatively correlated with ADC in the corresponding area. Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr in the tumor were positively correlated with p53 in the tumor, but negatively correlated with PTEN in the tumor. However, NAA/Cr of the tumor was irrelevant to the levels of PTEN and p53. CONCLUSIONS: The test results of DWI and MRS of patients with GBM can accurately reflect the inactivation or mutation of PTEN and p53.

Title: Pseudoprogression of brain tumors.
Abstract: This review describes the definition, incidence, clinical implications, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of pseudoprogression of brain tumors, in particular, but not limited to, high-grade glioma. Pseudoprogression is an important clinical problem after brain tumor treatment, interfering not only with day-to-day patient care but also the execution and interpretation of clinical trials. Radiologically, pseudoprogression is defined as a new or enlarging area(s) of contrast agent enhancement, in the absence of true tumor growth, which subsides or stabilizes without a change in therapy. The clinical definitions of pseudoprogression have been quite variable, which may explain some of the differences in reported incidences, which range from 9-30%. Conventional structural MRI is insufficient for distinguishing pseudoprogression from true progressive disease, and advanced imaging is needed to obtain higher levels of diagnostic certainty. Perfusion MRI is the most widely used imaging technique to diagnose pseudoprogression and has high reported diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic performance of MR spectroscopy (MRS) appears to be somewhat higher, but MRS is less suitable for the routine and universal application in brain tumor follow-up. The combination of MRS and diffusion-weighted imaging and/or perfusion MRI seems to be particularly powerful, with diagnostic accuracy reaching up to or even greater than 90%. While diagnostic performance can be high with appropriate implementation and interpretation, even a combination of techniques, however, does not provide 100% accuracy. It should also be noted that most studies to date are small, heterogeneous, and retrospective in nature. Future improvements in diagnostic accuracy can be expected with harmonization of acquisition and postprocessing, quantitative MRI and computer-aided diagnostic technology, and meticulous evaluation with clinical and pathological data.

Title: MR-spectroscopic imaging of glial tumors in the spotlight of the 2016 WHO classification.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to map spatial metabolite differences across three molecular subgroups of glial tumors, defined by the IDH1/2 mutation and 1p19q-co-deletion, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This work reports a new MR spectroscopy based classification algorithm by applying a radiomics analytics pipeline. MATERIALS: 65 patients received anatomical and chemical shift imaging (5 x 5 x 20 mm voxel size). Tumor regions were segmented and registered to corresponding spectroscopic voxels. Spectroscopic features were computed (n = 860) in a radiomic approach and selected by a classification algorithm. Finally, a random forest machine-learning model was trained to predict the molecular subtypes. RESULTS: A cluster analysis identified three robust spectroscopic clusters based on the mean silhouette widths. Molecular subgroups were significantly associated with the computed spectroscopic clusters (Fisher's Exact test p < 0.01). A machine-learning model was trained and validated by public available MRS data (n = 19). The analysis showed an accuracy rate in the Random Forest model by 93.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MR spectroscopy is a robust tool for predicting the molecular subtype in gliomas and adds important diagnostic information to the preoperative diagnostic work-up of glial tumor patients. MR-spectroscopy could improve radiological diagnostics in the future and potentially influence clinical and surgical decisions to improve individual tumor treatment.

Title: In Vitro Anticancer Activity of Staphyloxanthin Pigment Extracted from Staphylococcus gallinarum KX912244, a Gut Microbe of Bombyx mori.
Abstract: The present study reports the in vitro biological nature of the pigment produced by Staphylococcus gallinarum KX912244, isolated as the gut microflora bacterium of the insect Bombyx mori. The purified pigment was characterized as Staphyloxanthin based on bio-physical characterization techniques like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H NMR), Liquid chromatography-Mass spectroscopy and Gas chromatography-Mass spectroscopy. The Staphyloxanthin pigment presented considerable biological properties including in vitro antimicrobial activity against pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans; in vitro antioxidant activity by % DPPH free radical scavenging activity showing IC(50) value of 54.22 microg/mL; DNA damage protection activity against reactive oxygen species and anticancer activity evaluated by cytotoxicity assay against 4 different cancer cell lines like the Dalton's lymphoma ascites with IC(50) value 6.20 +/- 0.02 microg/mL, Ehrlich ascites carcinoma having IC(50) value 6.48 +/- 0.15 microg/mL, Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 Lung carcinoma) bearing IC(50) value 7.23 +/- 0.11 microg/mL and Mus mucus skin melanoma (B16F10) showing IC(50) value 6.58 +/- 0.38 microg/mL and less cytotoxicity towards non-cancerous human fibroblast cell lines (NIH3T3) with IC(50) value of 52.24 microg/mL. The present study results suggest that Staphyloxanthin acts as a potential therapeutic agent especially due to its anticancer property.

Title: Mutant IDH1 gliomas downregulate phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine synthesis in a 2-hydroxyglutarate-dependent manner.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have identified elevated levels of the phospholipid precursor phosphocholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE) as metabolic hallmarks of cancer. Unusually, however, PC and PE levels are reduced in mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDHmut) gliomas that produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) relative to wild-type IDH1 (IDHwt) gliomas. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this unusual metabolic reprogramming in IDHmut gliomas. METHODS: Steady-state PC and PE were quantified using (31)P-MRS. To quantify de novo PC and PE synthesis, we used (13)C-MRS and measured flux to (13)C-PC and (13)C-PE in cells incubated with [1,2-(13)C]-choline and [1,2-(13)C]-ethanolamine. The activities of choline kinase (CK) and ethanolamine kinase (EK), the enzymes responsible for PC and PE synthesis, were quantified using (31)P-MR-based assays. To interrogate the role of 2-HG, we examined IDHwt cells incubated with 2-HG and, conversely, IDHmut cells treated with the IDHmut inhibitor AGI-5198. To examine the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha), we silenced HIF-1alpha using RNA interference. To confirm our findings in vivo and in the clinic, we studied IDHwt and IDHmut orthotopic tumor xenografts and glioma patient biopsies. RESULTS: De novo synthesis of PC and PE was reduced in IDHmut cells relative to IDHwt. Concomitantly, CK activity and EK activity were reduced in IDHmut cells. Pharmacological manipulation of 2-HG levels established that 2-HG was responsible for reduced CK activity, EK activity, PC and PE. 2-HG has previously been reported to stabilize levels of HIF-1alpha, a known regulator of CK activity. Silencing HIF-1alpha in IDHmut cells restored CK activity, EK activity, PC and PE to IDHwt levels. Our findings were recapitulated in IDHmut orthotopic tumor xenografts and, most importantly, in IDHmut patient biopsies, validating our findings in vivo and in the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies, to our knowledge for the first time, a direct role for 2-HG in the downregulation of CK and EK activity, and thereby, PC and PE synthesis in IDHmut gliomas. These results highlight the unusual reprogramming of phospholipid metabolism in IDHmut gliomas and have implications for the identification of MRS-detectable metabolic biomarkers associated with 2-HG status.

Title: Malignancy probability map as a novel imaging biomarker to predict malignancy distribution: employing MRS in GBM patients.
Abstract: The main aim of this study was to propose a new statistical method for evaluation of spatial malignancy distribution within Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) grid in Glioblastoma Multiforme patients. Voxels with different malignancy probabilities were presented as a novel MRS-based Malignancy Probability Map (MPM). For this purpose, a predictive probability-based clustering approach was developed, including the two following steps: (1) Gaussian Mixture Model, (2) Quadratic Discriminate Analysis coupled with Genetic Algorithm. Clustered probability values from two methods were then integrated to exploit the MPM. Results show that the suggested method is able to estimate the malignancy distribution with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. The proposed MRS-based MPM has an acceptable accuracy for providing useful complementary information about regional diffuse glioma malignancy, with the potential to lead to better detection of tumoral regions with high probability of malignancy. So, it also may encourage the use of additional information of this map as a tool for dose painting.

Title: Metabolic Heterogeneity Evidenced by MRS among Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Multiforme Stem-Like Cells Accounts for Cell Clustering and Different Responses to Drugs.
Abstract: Clustering of patient-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) through unsupervised analysis of metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) evidenced three subgroups, namely clusters 1a and 1b, with high intergroup similarity and neural fingerprints, and cluster 2, with a metabolism typical of commercial tumor lines. In addition, subclones generated by the same GSC line showed different metabolic phenotypes. Aerobic glycolysis prevailed in cluster 2 cells as demonstrated by higher lactate production compared to cluster 1 cells. Oligomycin, a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, induced high lactate extrusion only in cluster 1 cells, where it produced neutral lipid accumulation detected as mobile lipid signals by MRS and lipid droplets by confocal microscopy. These results indicate a relevant role of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation for energy production in GSCs. On the other hand, further metabolic differences, likely accounting for different therapy responsiveness observed after etomoxir treatment, suggest that caution must be used in considering patient treatment with mitochondria FAO blockers. Metabolomics and metabolic profiling may contribute to discover new diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers to be used for personalized therapies.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Positron Emission Tomography and Radiogenomics-Relevance to Glioma.
Abstract: Advances in metabolic imaging techniques have allowed for more precise characterization of gliomas, particularly as it relates to tumor recurrence or pseudoprogression. Furthermore, the emerging field of radiogenomics where radiographic features are systemically correlated with molecular markers has the potential to achieve the holy grail of neuro-oncologic neuro-radiology, namely molecular diagnosis without requiring tissue specimens. In this section, we will review the utility of metabolic imaging and discuss the current state of the art related to the radiogenomics of glioblastoma.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of 2-hydroxyglutarate magnetic resonance spectroscopy in newly diagnosed brain mass and suspected recurrent gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations result in abnormal accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in gliomas that can be detected by MRS. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of 2HG single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and chemical shift imaging (CSI) in both newly diagnosed and posttreatment settings. METHODS: Long echo time (97 ms) SVS and CSI were acquired in 85 subjects, including a discovery cohort of 39 patients who had postoperative residual or recurrent glioma with confirmed IDH-mutation status and 6 normal volunteers, a prospective preoperative validation cohort of 24 patients with newly diagnosed brain mass, and a prospective recurrent-lesion validation cohort of 16 previously treated IDH-mutant glioma patients with suspected tumor recurrence. The optimal thresholds for both methods in diagnosing IDH status were determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis in the discovery cohort and then applied to the 2 validation cohorts to assess the diagnostic performance. RESULTS: The optimal 2HG/creatine thresholds of SVS and 75th percentile CSI for IDH mutations were 0.11 and 0.23, respectively. When applied to the validation sets, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in distinguishing IDH-mutant gliomas in the preoperative cohort were 85.71%, 100.00%, and 94.12% for SVS, and 100.00%, 69.23%, and 81.82% for CSI, respectively. In the recurrent-lesion cohort, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for discriminating IDH-positive recurrent gliomas were 40.00%, 62.50%, and 53.85% for SVS, and 66.67%, 100.00%, and 86.67% for CSI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 2HG MRS provides diagnostic utility for IDH-mutant gliomas both preoperatively and at time of suspected tumor recurrence. SVS has a better diagnostic performance for untreated IDH-mutant gliomas, whereas CSI demonstrates greater performance in identifying recurrent tumors.

Title: In vivo characterization of brain metabolism by (1) H MRS, (13) C MRS and (18) FDG PET reveals significant glucose oxidation of invasively growing glioma cells.
Abstract: Glioblastoma are notorious for their highly invasive growth, diffusely infiltrating adjacent brain structures that precludes complete resection, and is a major obstacle for cure. To characterize this "invisible" tumor part, we designed a high resolution multimodal imaging approach assessing in vivo the metabolism of invasively growing glioma xenografts in the mouse brain. Animals were subjected longitudinally to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (1) H spectroscopy (MRS) at ultra high field (14.1 Tesla) that allowed the measurement of 16 metabolic biomarkers to characterize the metabolic profiles. As expected, the neuronal functionality was progressively compromised as indicated by decreasing N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid and reduced neuronal TCA cycle (-58%) and neurotransmission (-50%). The dynamic metabolic changes observed, captured differences in invasive growth that was modulated by re-expression of the tumor suppressor gene WNT inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) in the orthotopic xenografts that attenuates invasion. At late stage mice were subjected to (13) C MRS with infusion of [1,6-(13) C]glucose and (18) FDG positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify cell-specific metabolic fluxes involved in glucose metabolism. Most interestingly, this provided the first in vivo evidence for significant glucose oxidation in glioma cells. This suggests that the infiltrative front of glioma does not undergo the glycolytic switch per se, but that environmental triggers may induce metabolic reprograming of tumor cells.

Title: Multiple cerebral gliomas mimicking central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases: A rare case with review of literature.
Abstract: RATIONALE: Multiple cerebral gliomas (MCGs), usually classified into multifocal and multicentric subtypes, represent major diagnostic challenges as their clinical, radiologic, and pathohistological features are not uniform, often mimicking brain metastatic tumors or central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDD). PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report a rare case of MCGs with isolated seizures and 4 lesions in the brain, that was initially misdiagnosed as IDD during treatment. DIAGNOSIS: The pathological diagnosis was astrocytoma, which was classified as a World Health Organization grade II glioma. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with dexamethasone and sodium valproate when he was misdiagnosed as having IDD. After the pathological diagnosis was obtained, he was treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy. OUTCOMES: Three months after the above treatment, the health of the patient had improved; he was asymptomatic, and presented with better radiological manifestations. LESSONS: Diagnostic imaging is valuable in differential diagnosis. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a promising technique for the assessment and characterization of lesions, though its role in definitive diagnosis is not yet defined. Brain tissue biopsy remains the golden standard for definitive diagnosis. In China, for various reasons, craniotomy biopsy is not performed routinely in patients with multiple intracranial lesions, and stereotactic cranial biopsy may be a more viable option because of its safety and cost-effectiveness. In summary, this case demonstrates that MCGs need to be included in the differential diagnosis of unknown intracranial multiple lesions.

Title: Diffuse low-grade glioma mimicking ischaemic infarct: a case report.
Abstract: Diffuse Low-Grade Gliomas (LGGs) include World Health Organization (WHO) grade II diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma. Since the neurological symptoms of LGGs are often subtle and deceptive, LGGs are easily overlooked at their early stage. Here, we report a case of a 49-year-old female with symptoms and imaging manifestations mimicking ischaemic infarct. After treatments for ischaemic stroke, the symptoms initially fluctuated and then aggravated. In addition, we found that the locations of the lesions did not match the vascular distribution and no obvious abnormalities were observed by Computed Tomography (CT) angiography and transcranial Doppler. The results from the Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and from the stereotactic biopsy directed to the final diagnosis of WHO grade II, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type diffuse astrocytoma. This is the first reported LGG case with a stroke-like onset. This case illustrates how easy it is to misdiagnose an LGG as a stroke if just using cerebral CT and magnetic resonance imaging. MRS and biopsy can assist with the differential diagnosis process thereby avoiding inappropriate or delayed treatments.

Title: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging of human glioblastomas at 1.5 Tesla.
Abstract: In this study we evaluated clinical feasibility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite mapping (1H MRSI) by using 1.5 Tesla MR-scanner in 10 patients with high-grade glioblastoma. In vivo 1H MRSI performed with a relatively short scan time of 20 minutes enabled to obtain comprehensive information about metabolic changes in glioblastoma and adjacent tissues namely in the peritumoral edema, in the middle and solid part of the tumor, and in the normal-appearing brain tissue. Spectroscopically it was possible to identify initiation of neuronal cell death in the solid tumorous tissue via decreased N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine ratio ( downward arrow tNAA/tCr) and expanding carcinogenesis reflected in elevated choline ratios ( upward arrow tCho/tCr and tCho/tNAA). We showed also the central necrosis of glioblastoma accompanied by the tissue hypoxia, which were apparent as increased lactate and lipids ratios ( upward arrow Lac/tCr and lip/Lac). Metabolic changes were noticeable also in the peritumoral area, showing the glioblastoma infiltration into the surrounding tissues. In intracranial tumors, 1H MRSI performed on 1.5 Tesla field strength was sufficient to provide information about the stage of carcinogenesis, tumor expansion or necrotization and thus it could be considered as a useful diagnostic tool in oncology.

Title: Intraoperative imaging technology to maximise extent of resection for glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Extent of resection is considered to be a prognostic factor in neuro-oncology. Intraoperative imaging technologies are designed to help achieve this goal. It is not clear whether any of these sometimes very expensive tools (or their combination) should be recommended as standard care for people with brain tumours. We set out to determine if intraoperative imaging technology offers any advantage in terms of extent of resection over standard surgery and if any one technology was more effective than another. OBJECTIVES: To establish the overall effectiveness and safety of intraoperative imaging technology in resection of glioma. To supplement this review of effects, we also wished to identify cost analyses and economic evaluations as part of a Brief Economic Commentary (BEC). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7, 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to June, week 4, 2017), and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 27). We searched the reference lists of all identified studies. We handsearched two journals, the Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology, from 1991 to 2017, including all conference abstracts. We contacted neuro-oncologists, trial authors, and manufacturers regarding ongoing and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating people of all ages with presumed new or recurrent glial tumours (of any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both). Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Interventions included intraoperative MRI (iMRI), fluorescence-guided surgery, ultrasound, and neuronavigation (with or without additional image processing, e.g. tractography). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for relevance, undertook critical appraisal according to known guidelines, and extracted data using a prespecified pro forma. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four randomised controlled trials, using different intraoperative imaging technologies: iMRI (2 trials including 58 and 14 participants, respectively); fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (1 trial, 322 participants); and neuronavigation (1 trial, 45 participants). We identified one ongoing trial assessing iMRI with a planned sample size of 304 participants for which results are expected to be published around autumn 2018. We identified no trials for ultrasound.Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to differences in the tumours included (eloquent versus non-eloquent locations) and variations in the image guidance tools used in the control arms (usually selective utilisation of neuronavigation). There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies. All studies included people with high-grade glioma only.Extent of resection was increased in one trial of iMRI (risk ratio (RR) of incomplete resection 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.96; 1 study, 49 participants; very low-quality evidence) and in the trial of 5-ALA (RR of incomplete resection 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.71; 1 study, 270 participants; low-quality evidence). The other trial assessing iMRI was stopped early after an unplanned interim analysis including 14 participants, therefore the trial provides very low-quality evidence. The trial of neuronavigation provided insufficient data to evaluate the effects on extent of resection.Reporting of adverse events was incomplete and suggestive of significant reporting bias (very low-quality evidence). Overall, reported events were low in most trials. There was no clear evidence of improvement in overall survival with 5-ALA (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07; 1 study, 270 participants; low-quality evidence). Progression-free survival data were not available in an appropriate format for analysis. Data for quality of life were only available for one study and suffered from significant attrition bias (very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative imaging technologies, specifically iMRI and 5-ALA, may be of benefit in maximising extent of resection in participants with high grade glioma. However, this is based on low to very low quality evidence, and is therefore very uncertain. The short- and long-term neurological effects are uncertain. Effects of image-guided surgery on overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life are unclear. A brief economic commentary found limited economic evidence for the equivocal use of iMRI compared with conventional surgery. In terms of costs, a non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that compared with standard surgery use of image-guided surgery has an uncertain effect on costs and that 5-aminolevulinic acid was more costly. Further research, including studies of ultrasound-guided surgery, is needed.

Title: Psychological consideration in patients with cerebral gliomas candidates for intra-operative radiation therapy based on tumor location.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Intra-operative Radiation Therapy (IORT) is gaining popularity as an adjuvant option to surgical resection, in treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) for increasing survival rate, which a highly aggressive cerebral tumor with poor prognosis. Tauhe authors plan to investigate the effects of IORT combined with surgical resection on the psychological status of these patients based on tumor location. SUBJECT AND METHODS: From December 2013 to February 2017, we have enrolled 109 patients with high grade cerebral gliomas, documented by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Patients with previous history of brain surgery or radiation, altered mental status and psychological content and patients diagnosed with metastases were excluded. Demographic data, tumor volume based on pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and psychological status were recorded based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. The remaining 56 patients, were equally randomized into conventional (surgical resection-group A), and trial (surgical resection with IORT-group B) who underwent IORT using the 50kV INTRABEAM(R) system (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany). Psychological profiles of both groups were re-evaluated in the 3(rd) post-operative month. RESULTS: Group A consisted of 18 males and 10 females with mean age of 54.4 years, while group B consisted of 16 males and 12 females with mean age of 57.8 years. Tumor volumetry revealed mean 81.52cc and 82.8cc for group A and B respectively. (P value 0.14) Patients were classified based on glioma location on pre-operative MRI: a) left parietal lobe (6 in group A, 5 in group B); b) left temporal lobe (7 in group A, 5 in group B); c) right parietal lobe (5 in group A, 6 in group B); d) left fronto-temporal lobe (4 in group A, 6 in group B); e) left parieto-temporal lobe (4 in group A, 5 in group B); and, f) right frontal lobe (2 in group A, 1 in group B). Group B received mean 8.05 Gy radiation for mean 11.2 minutes. Post-operative psychological in the 3(rd) month evaluation revealed the following in each class: a) Group A: 1 mild depression, Group B: 1 mild depression and 2 major depression; b) Group A: no disorder, Group B: 1 mild depression; c) no disorders in both groups; d) Group A: no disorder, Group B: 1 mild depression, 1 major depression and 1 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD); Conclusion: Utilization of IORT is shown to improve survival rate of patients suffering from GBM. However, the psychological status is a major determinating factor for the quality of life of these patients. Our study showed that IORT increased psychological disorders in patients with gliomas located in left parietal, left fronto-temporal and left parieto-temporal lobes and should be considered in pre-operative strategy selection.

Title: A comparison of 2-hydroxyglutarate detection at 3 and 7 T with long-TE semi-LASER.
Abstract: Abnormally high levels of the 'oncometabolite' 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) occur in many grade II and III gliomas, and correlate with mutations in the genes of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) isoforms. In vivo measurement of 2-HG in patients, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), has largely been carried out at 3 T, yet signal overlap continues to pose a challenge for 2-HG detection. To combat this, several groups have proposed MRS methods at ultra-high field (>/=7 T) where theoretical increases in signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution could improve 2-HG detection. Long echo time (long-TE) semi-localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (semi-LASER) (TE = 110 ms) is a promising method for improved 2-HG detection in vivo at either 3 or 7 T owing to the use of broad-band adiabatic localization. Using previously published semi-LASER methods at 3 and 7 T, this study directly compares the detectability of 2-HG in phantoms and in vivo across nine patients. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) of 2-HG fitting were found to be significantly lower at 7 T (6 +/- 2%) relative to 3 T (15 +/- 7%) (p = 0.0019), yet were larger at 7 T in an IDH wild-type patient. Although no increase in SNR was detected at 7 T (77 +/- 26) relative to 3 T (77 +/- 30), the detection of 2-HG was greatly enhanced through an improved spectral profile and increased resolution at 7 T. 7 T had a large effect on pairwise fitting correlations between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 2-HG (p = 0.004), and resulted in smaller coefficients. The increased sensitivity for 2-HG detection using long-TE acquisition at 7 T may allow for more rapid estimation of 2-HG (within a few spectral averages) together with other associated metabolic markers in glioma.

Title: 2-Hydroxyglutarate Detection by Short Echo Time Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Routine Imaging Study of Brain Glioma at 3.0 T.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effective performance of short echo time magnetic resonance spectroscopy (short TE MRS) for 2HG detection as biomarker of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status in all grade glioma (GL). METHODS: A total of 82 GL patients were prospectively investigated by short TE MRS at 3.0 T as part of a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study protocol. Spectral analysis was performed using linear combination model. Tumor specimens were diagnosed as IDH mutant or wild type according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors. Spectra were analyzed for the presence of 2HG. The performance of short TE MRS was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio on the overall sample and on GL WHO grades II and III and glioblastoma separately. RESULTS: The specificity and sensitivity estimated on the overall sample were 88% and 77%, respectively. In GL WHO grades II and III, 100% specificity and 75% sensitivity were estimated. CONCLUSIONS: We reiterate the feasibility to identify IDH status of brain GL using short TE MRS at 3.0 T. The method can correctly detect 2HG as expression of IDH mutation in WHO grades II and III GL with a 100% specificity but a 75% sensitivity. In the evaluation of glioblastoma, short TE MRS performs poorly having a 17% false positive rate.

Title: Online (1) H-MRS measurements of time-varying lactate production in an animal model of glioma during administration of an anti-tumoral drug.
Abstract: The aims of this study were to implement a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol for the online profiling of subnanomolar quantities of metabolites sampled from the extracellular fluid using implanted microdialysis and to apply this protocol in glioma-bearing rats for the quantification of lactate concentration and the measurement of time-varying lactate concentration during drug administration. MRS acquisitions on the brain microdialysate were performed using a home-built, proton-tuned, microsolenoid with an active volume of 2 muL. The microcoil was placed at the outlet of the microdialysis probe inside a preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. C6-bearing rats were implanted with microdialysis probes perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor oxamate. Microcoil magnetic resonance spectra were continuously updated using a single-pulse sequence. Localized in vivo spectra and high-resolution spectra on the dialysate were also acquired. The limit of detection and limit of quantification per unit time of the lactate methyl peak were determined as 0.37 nmol/ radicalmin and 1.23 nmol/ radicalmin, respectively. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the lactate methyl peak above 120 were obtained from brain tumor microdialysate in an acquisition time of 4 min. On average, the lactate methyl peak amplitude measured in vivo using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microcoil was 193 +/- 46% higher in tumor dialysate relative to healthy brain dialysate. A similar ratio was obtained from high-resolution NMR spectra performed on the collected dialysate. Following oxamate addition in the perfusate, a monotonic decrease in the lactate peaks was observed in all animals with an average time constant of 4.6 min. In the absence of overlapping NMR peaks, robust profiling of extracellular lactate can be obtained online using a dedicated sensitive NMR microcoil. MRS measurements of the dynamic changes in lactate production induced by anti-tumoral drugs can be assessed accurately with temporal resolutions on the order of minutes. The MRS protocol can be readily transferred to the clinical environment with the use of suitable clinical microdialysis probes.

Title: Myo-inositol concentration in MR spectroscopy for differentiating high grade glioma from primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to distinguish gliomas from other tumors on routine imaging. In this study, we assessed whether 3-T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with LCModel software might be useful for discriminating glioma from other brain tumors, such as primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) and metastatic tumors. A total of 104 cases of brain tumor (66 gliomas, 20 PCNSLs, 6 metastatic tumors, 12 other tumors) were preoperatively investigated with short echo time (35 ms) single-voxel 3-T MRS. LCModel software was used to evaluate differences in the absolute concentrations of choline, N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, glutamate + glutamine, myo-inositol (mIns), and lipid. mIns levels were significantly increased in high-grade glioma (HGG) compared with PCNSL (p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, mIns was the best marker for differentiating HGG from PCNSL (p < 0.0001, odds ratio 1.9927, 95% confidence interval 1.3628-3.2637). Conventional MRS detection of mIns resulted in a high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 90%; area under the receiver operator curve, 0.80) for HGG. The expression of inositol 3-phosphate synthase (ISYNA1) was significantly higher in gliomas than in PCNSLs (p < 0.05), suggesting that the increased level of mIns in glioma is due to high expression of ISYNA1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mIns-producing pathway. In conclusion, noninvasive analysis of mIns using single-voxel MRS may be useful in distinguishing gliomas from other brain tumors, particularly PCNSLs.

Title: Lactones from the Sponge-Derived Fungus Talaromyces rugulosus.
Abstract: The marine-derived fungus Talaromyces rugulosus isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Axinella cannabina and cultured on solid rice medium yielded seventeen lactone derivatives including five butenolides (1-5), seven (3S)-resorcylide derivatives (6-12), two butenolide-resorcylide dimers (13 and 14), and three dihydroisocoumarins (15-17). Among them, fourteen compounds (1-3, 6-16) are new natural products. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy as well as by ESI-HRMS (ElectroSpray Ionization-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry). TDDFT-ECD (Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory-Electronic Circular Dichroism) calculations were performed to determine the absolute configurations of chiral compounds. The butenolide-resorcylide dimers talarodilactones A and B (13 and 14) exhibited potent cytotoxicity against the L5178Y murine lymphoma cell line with IC(50) values of 3.9 and 1.3 microM, respectively.

Title: Highly specific determination of IDH status using edited in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme affect 40% of gliomas and represent a major diagnostic and prognostic marker. The goals of this study were to evaluate the performance of noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods to determine the IDH status of patients with brain gliomas through detection of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and to compare performance of these methods with DNA sequencing and tissue 2HG analysis. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with suspected diagnosis of low-grade glioma were included prospectively in the study. For all subjects, MRS data were acquired at 3T using 2 MRS methods, edited MRS using Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) sequence and a PRESS sequence optimized for 2HG detection, using a volume of interest larger than 6 mL. IDH mutational status was determined by a combination of automated immunohistochemical analysis and Sanger sequencing. Levels of 2HG in tissue samples measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were compared with those estimated by MRS. RESULTS: Edited MRS provided 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in the detection of 2HG. The 2HG levels estimated by this technique were in line with those derived from tissue samples. Optimized PRESS provided lower performance, in agreement with previous findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that edited MRS is one of the most reliable tools to predict IDH mutation noninvasively, showing high sensitivity and specificity for 2HG detection. Integrating edited MRS in clinical practice may be highly beneficial for noninvasive diagnosis of glioma, prognostic assessment, and treatment planning.

Title: Lymphomatosis cerebri: a rare variant of primary central nervous system lymphoma and MR imaging features.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) is a rare variant of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), characterized by diffuse infiltration without the formation of a discrete mass. The diagnosis of LC is a challenge because the imaging findings are atypical for lymphoma. The purpose of present study is to investigate MRI characteristics and clinical features of LC and potentially facilitate an early and accurate diagnosis of this often-missed disease. METHODS: Seven patients (average 44 years, 19-58 years) with LC proved basing on MRI and histology were retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and cerebral MR imaging findings. RESULTS: The common presenting symptoms were cognitive decline, behavioral disturbance, gait disturbance. All patients had both deep and lobar lesion distribution, and two of them had infratentorial involvement. Lack of contrast enhancement and subtle patchy enhanced pattern were observed in two and three patients, respectively. The remaining two patients presented multiple patchy enhancement. Most of the lesions were slightly hyperintense to normal brain on DWI as well as hyperintense on ADC maps. Three patients presented a pattern of marked decrease of NAA/Cr, increase of Cho/Cr, and two of the three cases showed increased Lip/Cr and Lac/Cr on MRS. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that diffuse bilateral lesions especially in deep and lobar region including white and gray matter, without enhancement or with patchy enhancement, marked decrease of NAA/Cr and increase of Cho/Cr, and increased Lip/Cr and Lac/Cr are suggestive of LC. Prompt recognition of these imaging patterns may lead to early diagnosis of LC and brain biopsy with improved prognosis.

Title: Reliable diagnosis of IDH-mutant glioblastoma by 2-hydroxyglutarate detection: a study by 3-T magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: We have previously reported that reliable detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas is possible utilizing 3.0-T single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SVMRS). We set out to determine whether the same method could be applied to detect 2HG in IDH-mutant glioblastoma. Forty-four patients harboring glioblastoma underwent pre-operative MRS evaluation to detect 2HG and other metabolites. Presence of IDH-mutations was determined by IDH1 R132H immunohistochemical analysis and DNA sequencing of surgically obtained tissues. Six out of 44 (13.6%) glioblastomas were IDH-mutant. IDH-mutant glioblastoma exhibited significantly higher accumulation of 2HG (median 3.191 vs. 0.000 mM, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). A cutoff of 2HG = 0.897 mM achieved high sensitivity (100.0%) and specificity (92.59%) in determining IDH-mutation in glioblastoma. Glioblastoma with high 2HG accumulation did not have significantly longer overall survival than glioblastoma with low 2HG accumulation (p = 0.107, log-rank test). Non-invasive and reliable detection of 2HG in IDH-mutant glioblastoma was possible by 3.0-T SVMRS.

Title: Isomers Identification of 2-hydroxyglutarate acid disodium salt (2HG) by Terahertz Time-domain Spectroscopy.
Abstract: 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid disodium salt (2HG) is a unique biomarker existing in glioma, which can be used for recognizing cancer development stage and identifying the boundary between the ordinary tissue and cancer tissue. However, the most efficient detection method for 2HG now is Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), whose testing time is at least twenty minutes and the variability of 2HG (continuous synthesis and decomposition) determines it cannot be used as the real-time image in medical surgery. In this paper, by using the Terahertz Time-domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) System, we investigate the vibration spectra of 2HG isomers and further distinguish their physical properties by using Density Functional Theory. The differences between isomers are mainly attributed to the proton transfer inside the carbon chain. These results indicate that terahertz technology can identify the isomers of 2HG accurate and fast, which has important significance for the further investigation of glioma and clinical surgery.

Title: MCT1 Inhibitor AZD3965 Increases Mitochondrial Metabolism, Facilitating Combination Therapy and Noninvasive Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) modulate tumor cell metabolism and offer promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Understanding the impact of MCT blockade on tumor cell metabolism may help develop combination strategies or identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers to support the clinical development of MCT inhibitors now in clinical trials. In this study, we assessed the impact of the MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 on cancer cell metabolism in vitro and in vivo Exposing human lymphoma and colon carcinoma cells to AZD3965 increased MCT4-dependent accumulation of intracellular lactate, inhibiting monocarboxylate influx and efflux. AZD3965 also increased the levels of TCA cycle-related metabolites and (13)C-glucose mitochondrial metabolism, enhancing oxidative pyruvate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase fluxes. Increased mitochondrial metabolism was necessary to maintain cell survival under drug stress. These effects were counteracted by coadministration of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor metformin and the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor UK5099. Improved bioenergetics were confirmed in vivo after dosing with AZD3965 in mouse xenograft models of human lymphoma. Our results reveal new metabolic consequences of MCT1 inhibition that might be exploited for therapeutic and pharmacodynamic purposes. Cancer Res; 77(21); 5913-24. (c)2017 AACR.

Title: Combining Functional Studies with Intraoperative MRI in Glioma Surgery.
Abstract: Maximal safe resection is the cornerstone of treatment for low-grade and high-grade gliomas. In addition to high-resolution anatomic MRI studies that highlight tumor architecture, it is important to determine the relationship of the tumor to the eloquent cortical and subcortical areas to avoid introducing or exacerbating a neurologic deficit. The goal of this review was to highlight imaging modalities that provide functional information and can be integrated with intraoperative MRI navigation to maximize the extent of resection while preserving a patient's neurologic function.

Title: Major Metabolite Levels of Preoperative Proton Magnetic Resonance Sectroscopy and Intraoperative Fluorescence Intensity in Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Objective To compare the intraoperative major metabolite level of preoperative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy((1)H-MRS)and fluorescence intensity marked with fluorescein sodium(FLs)in glioblastoma(GBM)and thus provide an objective basis for fluorescence surgical treatment of GBM. Methods All newly diagnosed patients by plain and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging from the April 1,2014 to December 31,2015 were enrolled in this study.All of them received (1)H-MRS and marked with FLs.The expression of Ki67 in tumor boundary were confirmed by postoperative pathology and determined by immunostaining assay.The relationship between (1)H-MRS metabolite levels and tumor fluorescence intensity was analyzed. Results Totally 33 patients were included in the study.Preoperative (1)H-MRS revealed high-grade gliomas in 25 cases.The N-acetylaspartate(NAA)decreased significantly and choline(Cho)increased significantly in high-grade gliomas.The ratios of Cho/NAA,NAA/creatine(Cr),and Cho/Cr significantly differed in different tumor regions(P=0.02,P=0.01,and P=0.00,respectively).Surgical results were marked with FLs intraoperatively.Tissue fluorescence were clearly seen.There were 29 patients undergoing total resection and 4 cases undergoing subtotal resection.No acute encephalocele occured after operation,while 2 patients suffered from epilepsy.Postoperative pathology results included:28 cases were diagnosed as GBM(22 cases consistent with (1)H-MRS diagnosis).The results of GBM fluorescence imaging included:the level of fluorescence intensity in tumor parenchyma was significantly higher than that in tumor boundary and peritumoral edema(P=0.01).The result of (1)H-MRS metabolite analysis included:The kurtosis of NAA and of Cho and the ratio of Cho/NAA were significantly different according the fluorescence intensity in tumor parenchyma(P=0.01,P=0.02,and P=0.01).While there was no difference in the kurtosis of NAA,the kurtosis of Cho and the ratio of Cho/NAA were significantly different according the fluorescence intensity in tumor boundary(P=0.02, P=0.00).In peritumoral edema,there was no significant different in kurtosis of NAA and of Cho and in the ratio of Cho/NAA(P=0.23,P=0.09,P=0.14).Immunohistochemistry in GBM tumor boundary showed different Ki67 expressions according to different fluorescence imaging(P=0.03). Conclusions The fluorescence intensity in GBM parenchyma is higher than that in other tumor regions,and there are different metabolic levels in different fluorescence intensity.The metabolic information marked by FLs and provided by (1)H-MRS before operationis are important,and the correlation between them should be further investigated.

Title: Effect of Brain Tumor Presence During Radiation on Tissue Toxicity: Transcriptomic and Metabolic Changes.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT) causes functional and transcriptomic changes in the brain; however, most studies have been carried out in normal rodent brains. Here, the long-term effect of irradiation and tumor presence during radiation was investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Male Wistar rats  approximately 7 weeks old were divided into 3 groups: sham implant, RT+sham implant, and RT+tumor implant (C6 glioma). Hypofractionated irradiation (8 or 6 Gy/day for 5 days) was localized to a 1-cm strip of cranium starting 5 days after implantation, resulting in complete tumor regression and prolonged survival. Biopsy of tissue was performed in the implant area 65 days after implantation. RNA was hybridized to GeneChip Rat Exon 1.0 ST array. Data were analyzed using significant analysis of microarrays and ingenuity pathway analysis. (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) imaging was performed in the implantation site 65 to 70 days after implantation using a 9.4 T Biospec magnetic resonance imaging scanner with a quadrature rat brain array. Immunohistochemical staining for astrogliosis, HMG-CoA synthase 2, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and taurine was performed at  approximately 65 days after implantation. RESULTS: Eighty-four genes had a false discovery rate <3.5%. We compared RT+tumor implant with RT+sham implant animals. The tumor presence affected networks associated with cancer/cell morphology/tissue morphology. (1)H-MRS showed significant reduction in taurine levels (P<.04) at the implantation site in both groups. However, the RT+tumor group also showed significant increase in levels of neurotransmitter GABA (P=.02). Hippocampal taurine levels were only significantly reduced in the RT+tumor group (P=.03). HMG-CoA synthase 2, GABA and taurine levels were confirmed using staining. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining demonstrated a significant increase in inflammation that was heightened in the RT+tumor group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that tumor presence during radiation significantly affects long-term functional transcriptomics landscape and neurotransmitter levels at the tumor implantation site/normal tissue, accompanied by increased inflammation (astrogliosis).

Title: Echo-planar spectroscopic imaging with dual-readout alternated gradients (DRAG-EPSI) at 7 T: Application for 2-hydroxyglutarate imaging in glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To develop echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with large spectral width and accomplish high-resolution imaging of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) at 7 T. METHODS: We designed a new EPSI readout scheme at 7 T. Data were recorded with dual-readout alternated gradients and combined according to the gradient polarity. Following validation of its performance in phantoms, the new readout scheme, together with previously reported 2HG-optimized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (point-resolved spectroscopy echo time of 78 ms), was used for time-efficient and high-resolution imaging of 2HG and other metabolites in five glioma patients before treatment. Unsuppressed water, acquired with EPSI, was used as reference for multichannel combination, eddy-current compensation, and metabolite quantification. Spectral fitting was conducted with the LCModel using in-house calculated basis sets. RESULTS: Using a readout gradient strength of 9.5 mT/m and slew rate of 90 mT/m/ms, dual-readout alternated gradients EPSI permitted 1638-Hz spectral width with 6 x 6 mm(2) in-plane resolution at 7 T. Phantom data indicated that dual-readout alternated gradients EPSI provides proper metabolite signals and induces much less frequency drifts than conventional EPSI. For a spatial resolution of 0.5 mL, 2HG was detected in tumors with precision (Cramer-Rao lower bound < 10%). The 2HG was estimated to be 2.3 to 3.3 mM in tumors of three patients with biopsy-proven isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant gliomas. The 2HG was undetectable in an IDH wild-type glioblastoma. For a radiographically suggested glioma, the estimated 2HG of 2.3 +/- 0.2 mM (Cramer-Rao lower bound < 10%) indicated that the lesion may be an IDH mutant glioma. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that the dual-readout alternated gradients EPSI can provide reliable high-resolution imaging of 2HG in glioma patients at 7 T in vivo.

Title: The Significance of Lactate and Lipid Peaks for Predicting Primary Neuroepithelial Tumor Grade with Proton MR Spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: (1)H-MRS is a non-invasive technique used to assess the metabolic activity of brain tumors. The technique is useful for the preoperative prediction of tumor grade, which is important for treatment planning and accurate prognosis. We used (1)H-MRS to study the lactate peak, which appears in various conditions, including hyperglycemia, ischemia, and hypoxia and lipid peak, which is associated with necrotic cells. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively examine the frequency and significance of lactate and lipid peaks in relation to brain tumor grade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients diagnosed with neuroepithelial tumors of Grades I (3 cases), II (11 cases), III (15 cases), and IV (26 cases) were enrolled. Biopsies were excluded. Single voxel (TE = 144 ms) point resolved (1)H-MRS spectroscopy sequences were retrospectively analyzed. An inverted doublet peak at 1.3 ppm was defined as lactate, a negative and positive peak was defined as combined lactate and lipid, and a clear upward peak was defined as lipid. RESULTS: Lactate peaks were detected in all grades of brain tumors and were least common in Grade II tumors (9.1%). The frequency of combined lactate-lipid peaks was 0% (Grades I and II), 8.3% (Grade III), and 44% (Grade IV). Grade IV tumors were significantly different to the other grades. There were three cases with a lipid peak. All were glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a lac peak may be useful to largely rule out the Grade II tumors, and allow the subsequent differentiation of Grade I tumors from Grade III or IV tumors by conventional imaging. The presence of a lipid peak may be associated with Grade IV tumors.

Title: Role of Multivoxel Intermediate TE 2D CSI MR Spectroscopy and 2D Echoplanar Diffusion Imaging in Grading of Primary Glial Brain Tumours.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Preoperative tumour grading is imperative owing to difference in invasive, aggressive tendencies of different grades of glial tumours implying varied prognosis, therapeutic options. Histopathological examination has inherent sampling errors. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) can provide non invasive information about internal mileu hence, aiding in tumour grading by adding to information provided by conventional MRI sequences. AIM: To evaluate the role of multivoxel intermediate TE 2D CSI MRS and 2D echoplanar diffusion imaging in grading of primary glial brain tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in Department of Radiology, Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College and Research Centre, Uttar Pradesh, India, from April 2015 to August 2016 after obtaining necessary approvals from Institutional Ethical Committee and written informed consent from all participants on histopathological proven cases of glial brain tumours that underwent multivoxel MRS using intermediate TE 2D chemical shift imaging and DWI using 2D echoplanar imaging. Tumour grade calculated on MRI using MRS and DWI was compared with histopathological grading. Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for each parameter and statistical significance was evaluated using two tailed Pearson test. RESULTS: Choline: N Acetyl aspartate (Cho: NAA) and Choline: creatinine (Cho: Cr) ratios from MRS as well as Apparent Diffusion Coffecient (ADC) values from DWI were significantly higher with increasing severity of tumour grade. Accuracy of 58.6% was obtained with DWI while it was 83% with MRS. MRS and DWI used together provided 88.4% accuracy. All parameters evaluated showed statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Both DWI as well as MRS were found to have statistically significant roles in grading of glial brain tumours. MRS was found to be more useful than DWI.

Title: In vitro nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolic biomarkers for the combination of temozolomide with PI3K inhibition in paediatric glioblastoma cells.
Abstract: Recent experimental data showed that the PI3K pathway contributes to resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in paediatric glioblastoma and that this effect is reversed by combination treatment of TMZ with a PI3K inhibitor. Our aim is to assess whether this combination results in metabolic changes that are detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, potentially providing metabolic biomarkers for PI3K inhibition and TMZ combination treatment. Using two genetically distinct paediatric glioblastoma cell lines, SF188 and KNS42, in vitro 1H-NMR analysis following treatment with the dual pan-Class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 resulted in a decrease in lactate and phosphocholine (PC) levels (P<0.02) relative to control. In contrast, treatment with TMZ caused an increase in glycerolphosphocholine (GPC) levels (P</=0.05). Combination of PI-103 with TMZ showed metabolic effects of both agents including a decrease in the levels of lactate and PC (P<0.02) while an increase in GPC (P<0.05). We also report a decrease in the protein expression levels of HK2, LDHA and CHKA providing likely mechanisms for the depletion of lactate and PC, respectively. Our results show that our in vitro NMR-detected changes in lactate and choline metabolites may have potential as non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring response to combination of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with TMZ during clinical trials in children with glioblastoma, subject to further in vivo validation.

Title: Advances in Imaging Brain Metabolism.
Abstract: Metabolism is central to neuroimaging because it can reveal pathways by which neuronal and glial cells use nutrients to fuel their growth and function. We focus on advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods used in brain metabolic studies. (17)O-MRS and (31)P-MRS, respectively, provide rates of oxygen use and ATP synthesis inside mitochondria, whereas (19)F-MRS enables measurement of cytosolic glucose metabolism. Calibrated functional MRI (fMRI), an advanced form of fMRI that uses contrast generated by deoxyhemoglobin, provides maps of oxygen use that track neuronal firing across brain regions. (13)C-MRS is the only noninvasive method of measuring both glutamatergic neurotransmission and cell-specific energetics with signaling and nonsignaling purposes. Novel MRI contrasts, arising from endogenous diamagnetic agents and exogenous paramagnetic agents, permit pH imaging of glioma. Overall, these magnetic resonance methods for imaging brain metabolism demonstrate translational potential to better understand brain disorders and guide diagnosis and treatment.

Title: Role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to differentiate high-grade gliomas from metastases.
Abstract: This study is to measure the diagnostic examination quality of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in differentiating high-grade gliomas from metastases. PubMed, Embase, and Chinese Biomedical databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published through 10 July 2016. Based on the data from eligible studies, heterogeneity and threshold effect tests were performed; pooled sensitivity, specificity, and areas under summary receiver-operating characteristic curve of magnetic resonance spectroscopy were calculated. Finally, seven studies with a total of 261 patients were included. Quantitative synthesis of studies showed that pooled sensitivity/specificity of Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr ratio in peritumoral region was 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.90)/0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.99) and 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.92)/0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.73-0.94). The area under the curve of the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.95 and 0.90. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify high-grade gliomas from metastases were 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.90), 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.90), and 0.90, respectively. We concluded that magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance in distinguishing high-grade gliomas from metastases. Furthermore, Cho/NAA ratio showed higher specificity and higher value of area under the curve than Cho/Cr ratio in peritumoral region. We suggest that Cho/NAA ratio of peritumoral region should be used to improve diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance spectroscopy for differentiating high-grade gliomas from metastases.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for Detection of 2-Hydroxyglutarate as a Biomarker for IDH Mutation in Gliomas.
Abstract: Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 genes are highly prevalent in gliomas and have been suggested to play an important role in the development and progression of the disease. Tumours harbouring these mutations exhibit a significant alteration in their metabolism resulting in the aberrant accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxygluarate (2-HG). As well as being suggested to play an important role in tumour progression, 2-HG may serve as a surrogate indicator of IDH status through non-invasive detection using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In this review, we describe the recent efforts in developing MRS methods for detection and quantification of 2-HG in vivo and provide an assessment of the role of the 2-HG in gliomagenesis and patient prognosis.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion-weighted imaging in brain gliomas follow-up: a single institutional experience.
Abstract: Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are able to increase diagnostic accuracy in the follow-up of brain gliomas, identifying the progression of disease before it becomes evident in the standard MRI; also to evaluate which of the two techniques has the best diagnostic accuracy. Methods Eighty-three patients with cerebral glioma (50 high-grade gliomas (HGGs), 33 low-grade gliomas (LGGs)) were retrospectively enrolled. All patients underwent standard MRI, H spectroscopic and perfusion echo-planar imaging MRI. For spectroscopy variations of choline/creatine, choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio, and lipids and lactates peak were considered. For perfusion 2.0 was considered the cerebral blood volume cut-off for progression. The combination of functional parameters gave a multiparametric score (0-2) to predict outcome. Diagnostic performance was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Results In patients with LGGs a combined score of at least 1 was the best predictor for progression (odds ratio (OR) 3.91) with 8.4 months median anticipation of diagnosis compared to standard MRI. The individual advanced magnetic resonance technique did not show a diagnostic accuracy comparable to the combination of the two. Overall diagnostic accuracy area under the curve (AUC) was 0.881. In patients with HGGs the multiparametric score did not improve diagnostic accuracy significantly. Perfusion MRI was the best predictor of progression (OR 3.65), with 6.7 months median anticipation of diagnosis. Overall diagnostic accuracy AUC was 0.897. Then spectroscopy and perfusion MRI are able to identify tumour progression during follow-up earlier than standard MRI. Conclusion In patients with LGGs the combination of the functional parameters seems to be the best method for diagnosis of progression. In patients with HGGs perfusion is the best diagnostic method.

Title: Pediatric and adult glioblastoma radiosensitization induced by PI3K/mTOR inhibition causes early metabolic alterations detected by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Poor outcome for patients with glioblastomas is often associated with radioresistance. PI3K/mTOR pathway deregulation has been correlated with radioresistance; therefore, PI3K/mTOR inhibition could render tumors radiosensitive. In this study, we show that NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, potentiates the effects of irradiation in both adult and pediatric glioblastoma cell lines, resulting in early metabolic changes detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitises cells to X ray exposure, inducing cell death through the inhibition of CDC25A and the activation of p21cip1(CDKN1A). Lactate and phosphocholine levels, increased with radiation, are decreased after NVP-BEZ235 and combination treatment, suggesting that inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR pathway reverses radiation induced metabolic changes. Importantly, NVP-BEZ235 potentiates the effects of irradiation in a xenograft model of adult glioblastoma, where we observed a decrease in lactate and phosphocholine levels after seven days of combination treatment. Although tumor size was not affected due to the short length of the treatment, a significant increase in CASP3 mRNA was observed in the combination group. Taken together, our data suggest that NMR metabolites could be used as biomarkers to detect an early response to combination therapy with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and radiotherapy in adult and pediatric glioblastoma patients.

Title: Metabolomic signature of brain cancer.
Abstract: Despite advances in surgery and adjuvant therapy, brain tumors represent one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in both adults and children. Gliomas constitute about 60% of all cerebral tumors, showing varying degrees of malignancy. They are difficult to treat due to dismal prognosis and limited therapeutics. Metabolomics is the untargeted and targeted analyses of endogenous and exogenous small molecules, which charact erizes the phenotype of an individual. This emerging "omics" science provides functional readouts of cellular activity that contribute greatly to the understanding of cancer biology including brain tumor biology. Metabolites are highly informative as a direct signature of biochemical activity; therefore, metabolite profiling has become a promising approach for clinical diagnostics and prognostics. The metabolic alterations are well-recognized as one of the key hallmarks in monitoring disease progression, therapy, and revealing new molecular targets for effective therapeutic intervention. Taking advantage of the latest high-throughput analytical technologies, that is, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), metabolomics is now a promising field for precision medicine and drug discovery. In the present report, we review the application of metabolomics and in vivo metabolic profiling in the context of adult gliomas and paediatric brain tumors. Analytical platforms such as high-resolution (HR) NMR, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and high- and low-resolution MS are discussed. Moreover, the relevance of metabolic studies in the development of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of gliomas are reviewed.

Title: Study protocol of a phase IB/II clinical trial of metformin and chloroquine in patients with IDH1-mutated or IDH2-mutated solid tumours.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: High-grade chondrosarcoma, high-grade glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are aggressive types of cancer with a dismal outcome. This is due to the lack of effective treatment options, emphasising the need for novel therapies. Mutations in the genes IDH1 and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2) occur in 60% of chondrosarcoma, 80% of WHO grade II-IV glioma and 20% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. IDH1/2-mutated cancer cells produce the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) and are metabolically vulnerable to treatment with the oral antidiabetic metformin and the oral antimalarial drug chloroquine. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe a dose-finding phase Ib/II clinical trial, in which patients with IDH1/2-mutated chondrosarcoma, glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are treated with a combination of metformin and chloroquine. Dose escalation is performed according to a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose to establish the recommended dose for a phase II clinical trial. Secondary objectives of the study include (1) determination of pharmacokinetics and toxic effects of the study therapy, for which metformin and chloroquine serum levels will be determined over time; (2) investigation of tumour responses to metformin plus chloroquine in IDH1/2-mutated cancers using CT/MRI scans; and (3) whether tumour responses can be measured by non-invasive D-2HG measurements (mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy) of tumour tissue, serum, urine, and/or bile or next-generation sequencing of circulating tumour DNA (liquid biopsies). This study may open a novel treatment avenue for IDH1/2-mutated high-grade chondrosarcoma, glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by repurposing the combination of two inexpensive drugs that are already approved for other indications. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the medical-ethical review committee of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This article was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT02496741): Pre-results.

Title: Non-caloric sweetener provides magnetic resonance imaging contrast for cancer detection.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Image contrast enhanced by exogenous contrast agents plays a crucial role in the early detection, characterization, and determination of the precise location of cancers. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using a non-nutritive sweetener, sucralose (commercial name, Splenda), as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for cancer studies. METHODS: High-resolution nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy and MR studies on sucralose solution phantom were performed to detect the chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) property of sucralose hydroxyl protons with bulk water (sucCEST). For the animal experiments, female Fisher rats (F344/NCR) were used to generate 9L-gliosarcoma model. MRI with CEST experiments were performed on anesthetized rats at 9.4 T MR scanner. Following the baseline CEST scans, sucralose solution was intravenously administered in control and tumor bearing rats. CEST acquisitions were continued during and following the administration of sucralose. Following the sucCEST, Gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was injected to perform Gd-enhanced imaging for visualizing the tumor. RESULTS: The sucCEST contrast in vitro was found to correlate positively with the sucralose concentration and negatively with the pH, indicating the potential of this technique in cancer imaging. In a control animal, the CEST contrast from the brain was found to be unaffected following the administration of sucralose, demonstrating its blood-brain barrier impermeability. In a 9L glioma model, enhanced localized sucCEST contrast in the tumor region was detected while the unaffected brain region showed unaltered CEST effect implying the specificity of sucralose toward the tumorous tissue. The CEST asymmetry plots acquired from the tumor region before and after the sucralose infusion showed elevation of asymmetry at 1 ppm, pointing towards the role of sucralose in increased contrast. CONCLUSIONS: We show the feasibility of using sucralose and sucCEST in study of preclinical models of cancer. This study paves the way for the potential development of sucralose and other sucrose derivatives as contrast agents for clinical MRI applications.

Title: Improving the utility of (1)H-MRS for the differentiation of glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) has shown promise in distinguishing recurrent high-grade glioma from posttreatment radiation effect (PTRE). The purpose of this study was to establish objective (1)H-MRS criteria based on metabolite peak height ratios to distinguish recurrent tumor (RT) from PTRE. A retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance imaging and (1)H-MRS data was performed. Spectral metabolites analyzed included N-acetylaspartate, choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), lactate (Lac), and lipids (Lip). Quantitative (1)H-MRS criteria to differentiate RT from PTRE were identified using 81 biopsy-matched spectral voxels. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted for all metabolite ratio combinations with the pathology diagnosis as the classification variable. Forward discriminant analysis was used to identify ratio variables that maximized the correct classification of RT versus PTRE. Our results were applied to 205 records without biopsy-matched voxels to examine the percent agreement between our criteria and the radiologic diagnoses. Five ratios achieved an acceptable balance [area under the curve (AUC) >/= 0.700] between sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing RT from PTRE, and each ratio defined a criterion for diagnosing RT. The ratios are as follows: Cho/Cr > 1.54 (sensitivity 66%, specificity 79%), Cr/Cho </= 0.63 (sensitivity 65%, specificity 79%), Lac/Cho </= 2.67 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 58%), Lac/Lip </= 1.64 (sensitivity 54%, specificity 95%), and Lip/Lac > 0.58 (sensitivity 56%, specificity 95%). Application of our ratio criteria in prospective studies may offer an alternative to biopsy or visual spectral pattern recognition to distinguish RT from PTRE in patients with gliomas.

Title: Measurement of glycine in healthy and tumorous brain by triple-refocusing MRS at 3 T in vivo.
Abstract: Glycine (Gly) has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including malignant brain tumors. The precise measurement of Gly is challenging largely as a result of the spectral overlap with myo-inositol (mI). We report a new triple-refocusing sequence for the reliable co-detection of Gly and mI at 3 T and for the evaluation of Gly in healthy and tumorous brain. The sequence parameters were optimized with density-matrix simulations and phantom validation. With a total TE of 134 ms, the sequence gave complete suppression of the mI signal between 3.5 and 3.6 ppm and, consequently, well-defined Gly (3.55 ppm) and mI (3.64 ppm) peaks. In vivo (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data were acquired from the gray matter (GM)-dominant medial occipital and white matter (WM)-dominant left parietal regions in six healthy subjects, and analyzed with LCModel using in-house-calculated basis spectra. Tissue segmentation was performed to obtain the GM and WM contents within the MRS voxels. Metabolites were quantified with reference to GM-rich medial occipital total creatine at 8 mM. The Gly and mI concentrations were estimated to be 0.63 +/- 0.05 and 8.6 +/- 0.6 mM for the medial occipital and 0.34 +/- 0.05 and 5.3 +/- 0.8 mM for the left parietal regions, respectively. From linear regression of the metabolite estimates versus fractional GM content, the concentration ratios between pure GM and pure WM were estimated to be 2.6 and 2.1 for Gly and mI, respectively. Clinical application of the optimized sequence was performed in four subjects with brain tumor. The Gly levels in tumors were higher than those of healthy brain. Gly elevation was more extensive in a post-contrast enhancing region than in a non-enhancing region. The data indicate that the optimized triple-refocusing sequence may provide reliable co-detection of Gly and mI, and alterations of Gly in brain tumors can be precisely evaluated.

Title: Accuracy of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy for quantification of 2-hydroxyglutarate using linear combination and J-difference editing at 9.4T.
Abstract: Non-invasive detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is attractive since it is related to tumor metabolism. Here, we compare the detection accuracy of 2HG in a controlled phantom setting via widely used localized spectroscopy sequences quantified by linear combination of metabolite signals vs. a more complex approach applying a J-difference editing technique at 9.4T. Different phantoms, comprised out of a concentration series of 2HG and overlapping brain metabolites, were measured with an optimized point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) and an in-house developed J-difference editing sequence. The acquired spectra were post-processed with LCModel and a simulated metabolite set (PRESS) or with a quantification formula for J-difference editing. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a high correlation of real 2HG values with those measured with the PRESS method (adjusted R-squared: 0.700, p<0.001) as well as with those measured with the J-difference editing method (adjusted R-squared: 0.908, p<0.001). The regression model with the J-difference editing method however had a significantly higher explanatory value over the regression model with the PRESS method (p<0.0001). Moreover, with J-difference editing 2HG was discernible down to 1mM, whereas with the PRESS method 2HG values were not discernable below 2mM and with higher systematic errors, particularly in phantoms with high concentrations of N-acetyl-asparate (NAA) and glutamate (Glu). In summary, quantification of 2HG with linear combination of metabolite signals shows high systematic errors particularly at low 2HG concentration and high concentration of confounding metabolites such as NAA and Glu. In contrast, J-difference editing offers a more accurate quantification even at low 2HG concentrations, which outweighs the downsides of longer measurement time and more complex postprocessing.

Title: Pyogenic brain abscess with atypical features resembling glioblastoma in advanced MRI imaging.
Abstract: Differentiation between infectious and neoplastic brain processes is crucial for treatment planning. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques, such as diffusion, perfusion, susceptibility weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, enhance the imaging differences between these two pathologies. However, despite the utilization of these advanced techniques, the pathologic process may be confound by atypical findings. Here, we report a case of an autistic patient with multiple brain lesions with diffusion weighted imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging, and perfusion patterns resembling features of a multicentric glioblastoma, which were confirmed surgically, neuropathologically, and bacteriologically as brain abscesses. We discuss the differentiation of these different entities in the light of advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques.

Title: Global brain atrophy and metabolic dysfunction in LGI1 encephalitis: A prospective multimodal MRI study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic cognitive deficits are frequent in leucin-rich glioma-inactivated 1 protein (LGI1) encephalitis. We examined structural and metabolic brain abnormalities following LGI1 encephalitis and correlated findings with acute and follow-up clinical outcomes. METHODS: Nine patients underwent prospective multimodal 3 Tesla MRI 33.1+/-18months after disease onset, including automated volumetry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Data were compared to 9 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Although extratemporal lesions were not present on MRI in the acute stage, tract-based spatial statistics analyses of DTI during follow-up showed widespread changes in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter (WM), most prominent in the anterior parts of the corona radiata, capsula interna and corpus callosum. MRS revealed lower glutamine/glutamate WM levels compared to controls. Higher cerebellar gray matter volume was associated with better function at disease onset (measured by the modified Rankin Scale), and higher putaminal volume was associated with better cognition by Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination test at 23.4+/-7.6months. CONCLUSIONS: Poor clinical outcome following LGI1 encephalitis is associated with global brain atrophy and disintegration of white matter tracts. The pathological changes affect not only temporomesial structures but also frontal lobes and the cerebellum.

Title: Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibition down- regulates CXCR4 expression and interferes with proliferation, invasion and glycolysis in glioma cells.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays a crucial role in tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive glioma. Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), a catabolic enzyme of PC metabolism, is involved in several aspects of cancer biology and its inhibition down-modulates the expression of growth factor membrane receptors interfering with their signaling pathways. In the present work we investigated the possible interplay between CXCR4 and PC-PLC in GBM cells. METHODS: Confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, western blot analyses, and the evaluation of migration and invasion potential were performed on U87MG cells after PC-PLC inhibition with the xanthate D609. The intracellular metabolome was investigated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; lactate levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were analyzed by colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Our studies demonstrated that CXCR4 and PC-PLC co-localize and are associated on U87MG cell membrane. D609 reduced CXCR4 expression, cell proliferation and invasion, interfering with AKT and EGFR activation and expression. Metabolic analyses showed a decrease in intracellular lactate concentration together with a decrement in LDH activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that inhibition of PC-PLC could represent a new molecular approach in glioma biology not only for its ability in modulating cell metabolism, glioma growth and motility, but also for its inhibitory effect on crucial molecules involved in cancer progression.

Title: Advanced MRI Techniques in the Monitoring of Treatment of Gliomas.
Abstract: With advances in treatments and survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM), it has become apparent that conventional imaging sequences have significant limitations both in terms of assessing response to treatment and monitoring disease progression. Both 'pseudoprogression' after chemoradiation for newly diagnosed GBM and 'pseudoresponse' after anti-angiogenesis treatment for relapsed GBM are well-recognised radiological entities. This in turn has led to revision of response criteria away from the standard MacDonald criteria, which depend on the two-dimensional measurement of contrast-enhancing tumour, and which have been the primary measure of radiological response for over three decades. A working party of experts published RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology Working Group) criteria in 2010 which take into account signal change on T2/FLAIR sequences as well as the contrast-enhancing component of the tumour. These have recently been modified for immune therapies, which are associated with specific issues related to the timing of radiological response. There has been increasing interest in quantification and validation of physiological and metabolic parameters in GBM over the last 10 years utilising the wide range of advanced imaging techniques available on standard MRI platforms. Previously, MRI would provide structural information only on the anatomical location of the tumour and the presence or absence of a disrupted blood-brain barrier. Advanced MRI sequences include proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), vascular imaging (perfusion/permeability) and diffusion imaging (diffusion weighted imaging/diffusion tensor imaging) and are now routinely available. They provide biologically relevant functional, haemodynamic, cellular, metabolic and cytoarchitectural information and are being evaluated in clinical trials to determine whether they offer superior biomarkers of early treatment response than conventional imaging, when correlated with hard survival endpoints. Multiparametric imaging, incorporating different combinations of these modalities, improves accuracy over single imaging modalities but has not been widely adopted due to the amount of post-processing analysis required, lack of clinical trial data, lack of radiology training and wide variations in threshold values. New techniques including diffusion kurtosis and radiomics will offer a higher level of quantification but will require validation in clinical trial settings. Given all these considerations, it is clear that there is an urgent need to incorporate advanced techniques into clinical trial design to avoid the problems of under or over assessment of treatment response.

Title: Progressive multifocal exophytic pontine glioblastoma: a case report with literature review.
Abstract: Multifocal pontine glioblastoma exhibiting an exophytic growth pattern in the cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) is rare. We present a case of a 5-year-old girl with consecutive neurological imaging and other clinical findings indicating progressive multifocal exophytic pontine glioblastoma. Three lesions were reported, of which two were initially presented, and one was developed 2 months later. One lesion demonstrated a progressing exophytic extension in the cistern of the left side of the CPA. The other two lesions were located and confined within the pons. Initial magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography-computed tomography indicated low-grade glioma or inflammatory disease. However, 2 and 3 months later, subsequent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) displayed elevated choline and depressed N-acetyl aspartate peaks compared with the peaks on the initial MRS, indicating a high-grade glioma. Subtotal resection was performed for the CPA lesion. Histopathologic examination showed discrepant features of different parts of the CPA lesion. The patient received no further chemotherapy or radiotherapy and died 2 months after surgery. The multifocal and exophytic features of this case and the heterogeneous manifestations on neurological images were rare and confusing for both diagnosis and surgical decision-making. Our case report may contribute knowledge and helpful guidance for other medical doctors.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging techniques for treatment response evaluation in patients with high-grade glioma, a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Treatment response assessment in high-grade gliomas uses contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI, but is unreliable. Novel advanced MRI techniques have been studied, but the accuracy is not well known. Therefore, we performed a systematic meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of anatomical and advanced MRI for treatment response in high-grade gliomas. METHODS: Databases were searched systematically. Study selection and data extraction were done by two authors independently. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model when >/=5 studies were included. RESULTS: Anatomical MRI (five studies, 166 patients) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 68% (95%CI 51-81) and 77% (45-93), respectively. Pooled apparent diffusion coefficients (seven studies, 204 patients) demonstrated a sensitivity of 71% (60-80) and specificity of 87% (77-93). DSC-perfusion (18 studies, 708 patients) sensitivity was 87% (82-91) with a specificity of 86% (77-91). DCE-perfusion (five studies, 207 patients) sensitivity was 92% (73-98) and specificity was 85% (76-92). The sensitivity of spectroscopy (nine studies, 203 patients) was 91% (79-97) and specificity was 95% (65-99). CONCLUSION: Advanced techniques showed higher diagnostic accuracy than anatomical MRI, the highest for spectroscopy, supporting the use in treatment response assessment in high-grade gliomas. KEY POINTS: * Treatment response assessment in high-grade gliomas with anatomical MRI is unreliable * Novel advanced MRI techniques have been studied, but diagnostic accuracy is unknown * Meta-analysis demonstrates that advanced MRI showed higher diagnostic accuracy than anatomical MRI * Highest diagnostic accuracy for spectroscopy and perfusion MRI * Supports the incorporation of advanced MRI in high-grade glioma treatment response assessment.

Title: Evaluation of human glioma using in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with expression of cyclooxygenase-2: a preliminary clinical trial.
Abstract: We sought to investigate the correlation between in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human glioma, and to advance their roles in diagnostic mapping and monitoring of glioma biological behavior. Thirty-nine patients with different grades of glioma (WHO classification I-IV) included in this study were scanned at 3.0 T MR before operation or biopsy puncture. Tumor morphology and H-MRS metabolites ratio [choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr)] were evaluated independently by two experienced radiologists. Paraffin-embedded glioma specimens were detected for the COX-2 expression using immunohistochemistry. Parametric and nonparametric tests including correlation, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were applied to assess the predicative roles and relation diagram of H-MRS and COX-2. The COX-2 expression showed a significant difference between low and high grade gliomas (P<0.01). Varying degrees of COX-2 expression have positive correlation with the Cho/Cr values in tumor zone (r=0.49, P=0.013), and showed not significant correlation with sex, age, and tumor location. For patients with high grade gliomas after surgery and radiation, COX-2 was associated with shortened survival in univariate analysis (P=0.025). The COX-2, Cho/Cr value and age were the significant prognostic indicators shown in multivariate survival analysis. The COX-2 and Cho/Cr value of H-MRS have correlation, and are both positive indicators for overall survival of human high grade glioma, and could be combined as a joint role to provide more evidences to assess the biological behavior.

Title: Noninvasive assessment of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status in cerebral gliomas by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a clinical setting.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes are of proven diagnostic and prognostic significance for cerebral gliomas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of using a recently described method for determining IDH mutation status by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect the presence of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), the metabolic product of the mutant IDH enzyme. METHODS By extending imaging time by 6 minutes, the authors were able to include a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) MRS sequence in their routine glioma imaging protocol. In 30 of 35 patients for whom this revised protocol was used the lesions were subsequently diagnosed histologically as gliomas. Of the remaining 5 patients, 1 had a gangliocytoma, 1 had a primary CNS lymphoma, and 3 had nonneoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemistry and/or polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the presence of IDH mutations in the glioma tissue resected. RESULTS In vivo MRS for 2HG correctly identified the IDH mutational status in 88.6% of patients. The sensitivity and specificity was 89.5% and 81.3%, respectively, when using 2 mM 2HG as threshold to discriminate IDH-mutated from wildtype tumors. Two glioblastomas that had elevated 2HG levels did not have detectable IDH mutations, and in 2 IDH-mutated gliomas 2HG was not reliably detectable. CONCLUSIONS The noninvasive determination of the IDH mutation status of a presumed glioma by means of MRS may be incorporated into a routine diagnostic imaging protocol and can be used to obtain additional information for patient care.

Title: Proton MR Spectroscopy and Diffusion MR Imaging Monitoring to Predict Tumor Response to Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy for Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Despite recent progress in conventional therapeutic approaches, the vast majority of glioblastoma recur locally, indicating that a more aggressive local therapy is required. Interstitial photodynamic therapy (iPDT) appears as a very promising and complementary approach to conventional therapies. However, an optimal fractionation scheme for iPDT remains the indispensable requirement. To achieve that major goal, we suggested following iPDT tumor response by a non-invasive imaging monitoring. Nude rats bearing intracranial glioblastoma U87MG xenografts were treated by iPDT, just after intravenous injection of AGuIX(R) nanoparticles, encapsulating PDT and imaging agents. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) allowed us an original longitudinal follow-up of post-treatment effects to discriminate early predictive markers. We successfully used conventional MRI, T2 star (T2*), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and MRS to extract relevant profiles on tissue cytoarchitectural alterations, local vascular disruption and metabolic information on brain tumor biology, achieving earlier assessment of tumor response. From one day post-iPDT, DWI and MRS allowed us to identify promising markers such as the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values, lipids, choline and myoInositol levels that led us to distinguish iPDT responders from non-responders. All these responses give us warning signs well before the tumor escapes and that the growth would be appreciated.

Title: A three-microRNA signature identifies two subtypes of glioblastoma patients with different clinical outcomes.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by aggressive growth, limited response to therapy, and inexorable recurrence. Because of the extremely unfavorable prognosis of GBM, it is important to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on biologically and clinically relevant patient stratification systems. Analyzing a collection of patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) by gene expression profiling, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and signal transduction pathway activation, we identified two GSC clusters characterized by different clinical features. Due to the widely documented role played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in the tumorigenesis process, in this study we explored whether these two GBM patient subtypes could also be discriminated by different miRNA signatures. Global miRNA expression pattern was analyzed by oblique principal component analysis and principal component analysis. By a combined inferential strategy on PCA results, we identified a reduced set of three miRNAs - miR-23a, miR-27a, and miR-9* (miR-9-3p) - able to discriminate the proneural- and mesenchymal-like GSC phenotypes as well as mesenchymal and proneural subtypes of primary GBM included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant correlation between the selected miRNAs and overall survival in 429 GBM specimens from TCGA-identifying patients who had an unfavorable outcome. The survival prognostic capability of the three-miRNA signatures could have important implications for the understanding of the biology of GBM subtypes and could be useful in patient stratification to facilitate interpretation of results from clinical trials.

Title: Prospective Longitudinal Analysis of 2-Hydroxyglutarate Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Identifies Broad Clinical Utility for the Management of Patients With IDH-Mutant Glioma.
Abstract: Purpose Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain can detect 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), the oncometabolite produced in neoplasms harboring a mutation in the gene coding for isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH). We conducted a prospective longitudinal imaging study to determine whether quantitative assessment of 2HG by MRS could serve as a noninvasive clinical imaging biomarker for IDH-mutated gliomas. Patients and Methods 2HG MRS was performed in 136 patients using point-resolved spectroscopy at 3 T in parallel with standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging and assessment. Data were analyzed in patient cohorts representing the major phases of the glioma clinical course and were further subgrouped by histology and treatment type to evaluate 2HG. Histologic correlations were performed. Results Quantitative 2HG MRS was technically and biologically reproducible. 2HG concentration > 1 mM could be reliably detected with high confidence. During the period of indolent disease, 2HG concentration varied by less than +/- 1 mM, and it increased sharply with tumor progression. 2HG concentration was positively correlated with tumor cellularity and significantly differed between high- and lower-grade gliomas. In response to cytotoxic therapy, 2HG concentration decreased rapidly in 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas and with a slower time course in astrocytomas and mixed gliomas. The magnitude and time course of the decrease in 2HG concentration and magnitude of the decrease in tumor volume did not differ between oligodendrogliomas treated with temozolomide or carmustine. Criteria for 2HG MRS were established to make a presumptive molecular diagnosis of an IDH mutation in gliomas technically unable to undergo a surgical procedure. Conclusion 2HG concentration as measured by MRS was reproducible and reliably reflected the disease state. These data provide a basis for incorporating 2HG MRS into clinical management of IDH-mutated gliomas.

Title: Assessment of alterations in X-ray irradiation-induced DNA damage of glioma cells by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Glioma is one of the most common types of brain tumors. DNA damage is closely associated with glioma cell apoptosis induced by X-ray irradiation. Alterations of metabolites in glioma can be detected noninvasively by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. To noninvasively explore the micro mechanism in X-ray irradiation-induced apoptosis, the relationship between metabolites and DNA damage in glioma cells was investigated. Three glioma cell lines (C6, U87 and U251) were randomly designated as control (0Gy) and treatment groups (1, 5, 10, 15Gy). After X-ray exposure, each group was separated into four parts: (i) to detect metabolites by 1H NMR spectroscopy; (ii) to make cell colonies; (iii) to detect cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate by flow cytometry; and (iv) to measure DNA damage by comet assay. The metabolite ratios of lactate/creatine and succinate/creatine decreased (lactate/creatine: C6, 22.17-66.27%; U87, 15.93-44.56%; U251, 26.27-74.48%. succinate/creatine: C6, 14.41-48.35%; U87, 22.03-70.62%; U251, 17.33-60.06%) and choline/creatine increased (C6, 52.22-389.68%; U87, 56.15-82.36%; U251, 31.87-278.62%) in the treatment groups compared with the control group (each P<0.05), which linearly depended on DNA damage. An increasing dose of X-ray irradiation increased numbers of apoptotic cells (P<0.01), and the DNA damage parameters were dose-dependent (P<0.05). The colony-forming rate declined (P<0.01) and the percentage of cells at G1 stage increased when exposed to 1Gy X-ray (three cell lines, P<0.05). Metabolite alterations detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy can be used to determine DNA damage induced by X-ray irradiation. 1H NMR spectroscopy is a noninvasive method to predict DNA damage of glioma cell at the micro level.

Title: Multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy identifies enriched foci of cancer stem-like cells in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the correlation between choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratios determined by multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and the distribution of cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in high-grade gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with high-grade gliomas were recruited and underwent (1)H-MRS examination before surgery to identify distinct tumor regions with variable Cho/Cr ratios. Using intraoperative neuronavigation, tumor tissues were accurately sampled from regions with high and low Cho/Cr ratios within each tumor. The distribution of CSLCs in samples from glioma tissue regions with different Cho/Cr ratios was quantified by neurosphere culture, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. RESULTS: The mean neurosphere formation rate in tissues with high Cho/Cr ratios was significantly increased compared with that in low Cho/Cr ratio tissues (13.94+/-5.94 per 100 cells vs 8.04+/-3.99 per 100 cells, P<0.001). Immunohistochemistry indicated that tissues with high Cho/Cr ratios had elevated expression of CD133, nestin, and CD15, relative to low Cho/Cr ratio tissue samples (23.6%+/-3.8% vs 18.3%+/-3.3%, 25.2%+/-4.5% vs 19.8%+/-2.8%, 24.5%+/-3.8% vs 17.8%+/-2.2%, respectively; all P<0.001). Western blot demonstrated that relative CD133 and nestin protein expression in high Cho/Cr ratio regions was significantly higher than that in low Cho/Cr ratio tissue samples (0.50+/-0.17 vs 0.30+/-0.08, 0.45+/-0.13 vs 0.27+/-0.07, respectively; both P<0.001). The protein expression levels of CD133 and nestin were highly correlated with Cho/Cr ratios (r=0.897 and r=0.861, respectively). CONCLUSION: Cho/Cr ratios correlate with the distribution of CSLCs in high-grade gliomas, and this may assist in identifying foci enriched with CSLCs and thus improve the management of high-grade gliomas.

Title: Radiologic Dilemma in an Extra-Axial Petroclival Lesion: Low Grade versus High Grade.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiologic differentiation between a low-grade and high-grade lesion is crucial when deciding extent of resection and prognostication. Occasionally, imaging features can be confusing between the 2 lesions. We report a case that presented such a radiologic dilemma. The lesion appeared benign and extra-axial on routine magnetic resonance imaging sequences. However, subtle clinical and imaging clues pointed to a high-grade lesion. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old woman presented with multiple cranial nerve palsies, gait ataxia, and features of increased intracranial pressure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a petroclival extra-axial contrast-enhancing lesion with areas of chunky calcification. Although choline peak on spectroscopy raised suspicion of a high-grade lesion, the primary differential diagnosis included meningioma and schwannoma considering its characteristic imaging appearance. Postoperative histopathology showed the lesion to be giant cell glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from reporting a rare variant of glioblastoma in an unusual location, this case highlights atypical imaging in a glioblastoma. Brainstem edema may be a subtle indicator of the infiltrative nature of a tumor. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be a useful adjunct in such circumstances.

Title: Simulating the Effect of Spectroscopic MRI as a Metric for Radiation Therapy Planning in Patients with Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Due to glioblastoma's infiltrative nature, an optimal radiation therapy (RT) plan requires targeting infiltration not identified by anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, high-resolution, whole-brain spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) is used to describe tumor infiltration alongside anatomical MRI and simulate the degree to which it modifies RT target planning. In 11 patients with glioblastoma, data from preRT sMRI scans were processed to give high-resolution, whole-brain metabolite maps normalized by contralateral white matter. Maps depicting choline to N-Acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) ratios were registered to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted RT planning MRI for each patient. Volumes depicting metabolic abnormalities (1.5-, 1.75-, and 2.0-fold increases in Cho/NAA ratios) were compared with conventional target volumes and contrast-enhancing tumor at recurrence. sMRI-modified RT plans were generated to evaluate target volume coverage and organ-at-risk dose constraints. Conventional clinical target volumes and Cho/NAA abnormalities identified significantly different regions of microscopic infiltration with substantial Cho/NAA abnormalities falling outside of the conventional 60 Gy isodose line (41.1, 22.2, and 12.7 cm(3), respectively). Clinical target volumes using Cho/NAA thresholds exhibited significantly higher coverage of contrast enhancement at recurrence on average (92.4%, 90.5%, and 88.6%, respectively) than conventional plans (82.5%). sMRI-based plans targeting tumor infiltration met planning objectives in all cases with no significant change in target coverage. In 2 cases, the sMRI-modified plan exhibited better coverage of contrast-enhancing tumor at recurrence than the original plan. Integration of the high-resolution, whole-brain sMRI into RT planning is feasible, resulting in RT target volumes that can effectively target tumor infiltration while adhering to conventional constraints.

Title: Changes in cerebral metabolism during ketogenic diet in patients with primary brain tumors: (1)H-MRS study.
Abstract: Normal brain cells depend on glucose metabolism, yet they have the flexibility to switch to the usage of ketone bodies during caloric restriction. In contrast, tumor cells lack genomic and metabolic flexibility and are largely dependent on glucose. Ketogenic-diet (KD) was suggested as a therapeutic option for malignant brain cancer. This study aimed to detect metabolic brain changes in patients with malignant brain gliomas on KD using proton magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). Fifty MR scans were performed longitudinally in nine patients: four patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GB) treated with KD in addition to bevacizumab; one patient with gliomatosis-cerebri treated with KD only; and four patients with recurrent GB who did not receive KD. MR scans included conventional imaging and (1)H-MRS acquired from normal appearing-white-matter (NAWM) and lesion. High adherence to KD was obtained only in two patients, based on high urine ketones; in these two patients ketone bodies, Acetone and Acetoacetate were detected in four MR spectra-three within the NAWM and one in the lesion area -4 and 25 months following initiation of the diet. No ketone-bodies were detected in the control group. In one patient with gliomatosis-cerebri, who adhered to the diet for 3 years and showed stable disease, an increase in glutamin + glutamate and reduction in N-Acetyl-Aspartate and myo-inositol were detected during KD. (1)H-MRS was able to detect ketone-bodies in patients with brain tumors who adhered to KD. Yet it remains unclear whether accumulation of ketone bodies is due to increased brain uptake or decreased utilization of ketone bodies within the brain.

Title: Myoinositol as a Biomarker in Recurrent Glioblastoma Treated with Bevacizumab: A 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Antiangiogenic treatment of glioblastomas with Bevacizumab lacks predictive markers. Myoinositol (MI) is an organic osmolyte, with intracellular concentration changes depending on the extracellular osmolality. Since Bevacizumab markedly reduces tumor edema and influences the tumor microenvironment, we investigated whether the MI concentration in the tumor changes during therapy. METHODS: We used 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure the MI concentrations in the tumor and contralateral control tissue of 39 prospectively recruited patients with recurrent glioblastomas before and 8-12 weeks after starting therapy. 30 patients received Bevacizumab and 9 patients were treated with CCNU/VM26 as control. We performed a survival analysis to evaluate MI as a predictive biomarker for Bevacizumab therapy. RESULTS: MI concentrations increased significantly during Bevacizumab therapy in tumor (p < .001) and control tissue (p = .001), but not during CCNU/VM26 treatment. For the Bevacizumab cohort, higher MI concentrations in the control tissue at baseline (p = .021) and higher differences between control and tumor tissue (delta MI, p = .011) were associated with longer survival. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median OS of 164 days for patients with a deltaMI < 1,817 mmol/l and 275 days for patients with a deltaMI > 1,817 mmol/l. No differences were observed for the relative changes or the post treatment concentrations. Additionally calculated creatine concentrations showed no differences in between subgroups or between pre and post treatment measurements. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that recurrent glioblastoma shows a strong metabolic reaction to Bevacizumab. Further, our results support the hypothesis that MI might be a marker for early tumor cell invasion. Pre-therapeutic MI concentrations are predictive of overall survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with Bevacizumab.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography in the Evaluation of Cerebral Tumors: A Case Report.
Abstract: In their daily clinical practice, physicians have to confront diagnostic dilemmas which cannot be resolved by the application of only one imaging technique. In this case report, we present a 66-year-old woman who was admitted to our institution for the surgical resection of a recently diagnosed brain tumor. The patient had a history of epileptic seizures and was hospitalized in the past for anti-phospholipid syndrome related to a non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed an enhancing right parasagittal lesion with significant edema suggestive of a high grade glioma. Advanced MRI techniques including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) showed findings compatible of glioma. An additional examination was performed as part of a protocol that we are routinely performing in our institution for all brain tumors including not only the gold standard advanced MRI techniques but also single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m (Tc99m). Brain SPECT indicated the presence of a meningioma which was verified by the histopathology of the resected specimen. In conclusion, a multimodality approach for the pre-surgical assessment of brain tumors has significant advantages not only for the diagnosis but also for the evaluation of intracranial tumors histology.

Title: Discrepant longitudinal volumetric and metabolic evolution of diffuse intrinsic Pontine gliomas during treatment: implications for current response assessment strategies.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Based on clinical observations, we hypothesized that in infiltrative high-grade brainstem neoplasms, such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), longitudinal metabolic evaluation of the tumor by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may be more accurate than volumetric data for monitoring the tumor's biological evolution during standard treatment. METHODS: We evaluated longitudinal MRS data and corresponding tumor volumes of 31 children with DIPG. We statistically analyzed correlations between tumor volume and ratios of Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr at key time points during the course of the disease through the end of the progression-free survival period. RESULTS: By the end of RT, tumor volume had significantly decreased from the baseline (P < .0001) and remained decreased through the last available follow-up magnetic resonance imaging study (P = .007632). However, the metabolic profile of the tumor tissue (Cho/Cr, NAA/Cr, and Cho/NAA ratios) did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSION: Our data show that longitudinal tumor volume and metabolic profile changes are dissociated in patients with DIPG during progression-free survival. Volume changes, therefore, may not accurately reflect treatment-related changes in tumor burden. This study adds to the existing body of evidence that the value of conventional MRI metrics, including volumetric data, needs to be reevaluated critically and, in infiltrative tumors in particular, may not be useful as study end-points in clinical trials. We submit that advanced quantitative MRI data, including robust, MRS-based metabolic ratios and diffusion and perfusion metrics, may be better surrogate markers of key end-points in clinical trials.

Title: MR Molecular Imaging of Brain Cancer Metabolism Using Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Metabolic reprogramming is an important hallmark of cancer. Alterations in many metabolic pathways support the requirement for cellular building blocks that are essential for cancer cell proliferation. This metabolic reprogramming can be imaged using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). H MRS can inform on alterations in the steady-state levels of cellular metabolites, but the emergence of hyperpolarized C MRS has now also enabled imaging of metabolic fluxes in real-time, providing a new method for tumor detection and monitoring of therapeutic response. In the case of glioma, preclinical cell and animal studies have shown that the hyperpolarized C MRS metabolic imaging signature is specific to tumor type and can distinguish between mutant IDH1 glioma and primary glioblastoma. Here, we review these findings, first describing the main metabolic pathways that are altered in the different glioma subtypes, and then reporting on the use of hyperpolarized C MRS and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to probe these pathways. We show that the future translation of this hyperpolarized C MRS molecular metabolic imaging method to the clinic promises to improve the noninvasive detection, characterization, and response-monitoring of brain tumors resulting in improved patient diagnosis and clinical management.

Title: Multiparametric Imaging Analysis: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a magnetic resonance-based imaging modality that allows noninvasive sampling of metabolic changes in normal and abnormal brain parenchyma. MRS is particularly useful in the differentiation of developmental or non-neoplastic disorders from neoplastic processes. MRS is also useful during routine imaging follow-up after radiation treatment or during antiangiogenic treatment and for predicting outcomes and treatment response. The objective of this article is to provide a concise but thorough review of the basic physical principles, important applications of MRS in brain tumor imaging, and future directions.

Title: Reciprocal regulation of the cholinic phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma cells.
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor with very limited therapeutic options. Standard multimodal treatments, including surgical resection and combined radio-chemotherapy do not target the most aggressive subtype of glioma cells, brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). BTSCs are thought to be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, and relapse. Furthermore, they have been associated with the expression of mesenchymal features as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) thereby inducing tumor dissemination and chemo resistance. Using high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) on GBM cell cultures we provide evidence that the expression of well-known EMT activators of the ZEB, TWIST and SNAI families and EMT target genes N-cadherin and VIMENTIN is associated with aberrant choline metabolism. The cholinic phenotype is characterized by high intracellular levels of phosphocholine and total choline derivatives and was associated with malignancy in various cancers. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the cardinal choline metabolism regulator choline kinase alpha (CHKalpha) significantly reduces the cell viability, invasiveness, clonogenicity, and expression of EMT associated genes in GBM cells. Moreover, in some cell lines synergetic cytotoxic effects were observed when combining the standard of care chemotherapeutic temozolomide with the CHKalpha inhibitor V-11-0711. Taken together, specific inhibition of the enzymatic activity of CHKalpha is a powerful strategy to suppress EMT which opens the possibility to target chemo-resistant BTSCs through impairing their mesenchymal transdifferentiation. Moreover, the newly identified EMT-oncometabolic network may be helpful to monitor the invasive properties of glioblastomas and the success of anti-EMT therapy.

Title: In-Vivo Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of 2-Hydroxyglutarate in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-Mutated Gliomas: A Technical Review for Neuroradiologists.
Abstract: The diagnostic and prognostic potential of an onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) as a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) detectable biomarker of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated (IDH-MT) gliomas has drawn attention of neuroradiologists recently. However, due to severe spectral overlap with background signals, quantification of 2HG can be very challenging. In this technical review for neuroradiologists, first, the biochemistry of 2HG and its significance in the diagnosis of IDH-MT gliomas are summarized. Secondly, various 1H-MRS methods used in the previous studies are outlined. Finally, wereview previous in vivo studies, and discuss the current status of 1H-MRS in the diagnosis of IDH-MT gliomas.

Title: Improved localisation for 2-hydroxyglutarate detection at 3T using long-TE semi-LASER.
Abstract: 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) has emerged as a biomarker of tumour cell IDH mutations that may enable the differential diagnosis of glioma patients. At 3 Tesla, detection of 2-HG with magnetic resonance spectroscopy is challenging because of metabolite signal overlap and a spectral pattern modulated by slice selection and chemical shift displacement. Using density matrix simulations and phantom experiments, an optimised semi-LASER scheme (TE = 110 ms) improves localisation of the 2-HG spin system considerably compared to an existing PRESS sequence. This results in a visible 2-HG peak in the in vivo spectra at 1.9 ppm in the majority of IDH mutated tumours. Detected concentrations of 2-HG were similar using both sequences, although the use of semi-LASER generated narrower confidence intervals. Signal overlap with glutamate and glutamine, as measured by pairwise fitting correlation was reduced. Lactate was readily detectable across glioma patients using the method presented here (mean CLRB: (10+/-2)%). Together with more robust 2-HG detection, long TE semi-LASER offers the potential to investigate tumour metabolism and stratify patients in vivo at 3T.

Title: Towards Real-time Metabolic Profiling of Cancer with Hyperpolarized Succinate.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The energy-yielding mitochondrial Krebs cycle has been shown in many cancers and other diseases to be inhibited or mutated. In most cells, the Krebs cycle with oxidative phosphorylation generates approximately 90% of the adenosine triphosphate in the cell. We designed and hyperpolarized carbon-13 labeled succinate (SUC) and its derivative diethyl succinate (DES) to interrogate the Krebs cycle in real-time in cancer animal models. PROCEDURES: Using Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP), we generated hyperpolarized SUC and DES by hydrogenating their respective fumarate precursors. DES and SUC metabolism was studied in five cancer allograft animal models: breast (4T1), Renal Cell Carcinoma (RENCA), colon (CT26), lymphoma NSO, and lymphoma A20. RESULTS: The extent of hyperpolarization was 8 +/- 2% for SUC and 2.1 +/- 0.6% for DES. The metabolism of DES and SUC in the Krebs cycle could be followed in animals 5 s after tail vein injection. The biodistribution of the compounds was observed using (13)C FISP imaging. We observed significant differences in uptake and conversion of both compounds in different cell types both in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: With hyperpolarized DES and SUC, we are able to meet many of the requirements for a useable in vivo metabolic imaging compound - high polarization, relatively long T(1) values, low toxicity and high water solubility. However, succinate and its derivative DES are metabolized robustly by RENCA but not by the other cancer models. Our results underscore the heterogeneity of cancer cells and the role cellular uptake plays in hyperpolarized metabolic spectroscopy.

Title: Hyperpolarized (13)C MR imaging detects no lactate production in mutant IDH1 gliomas: Implications for diagnosis and response monitoring.
Abstract: Metabolic imaging of brain tumors using (13)C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate is a promising neuroimaging strategy which, after a decade of preclinical success in glioblastoma (GBM) models, is now entering clinical trials in multiple centers. Typically, the presence of GBM has been associated with elevated hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate produced from [1-(13)C] pyruvate, and response to therapy has been associated with a drop in hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate. However, to date, lower grade gliomas had not been investigated using this approach. The most prevalent mutation in lower grade gliomas is the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, which, in addition to initiating tumor development, also induces metabolic reprogramming. In particular, mutant IDH1 gliomas are associated with low levels of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4 (MCT1, MCT4), three proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism to lactate. We therefore investigated the potential of (13)C MRS of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate for detection of mutant IDH1 gliomas and for monitoring of their therapeutic response. We studied patient-derived mutant IDH1 glioma cells that underexpress LDHA, MCT1 and MCT4, and wild-type IDH1 GBM cells that express high levels of these proteins. Mutant IDH1 cells and tumors produced significantly less hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate compared to GBM, consistent with their metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate production was not affected by chemotherapeutic treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) in mutant IDH1 tumors, in contrast to previous reports in GBM. Our results demonstrate the unusual metabolic imaging profile of mutant IDH1 gliomas, which, when combined with other clinically available imaging methods, could be used to detect the presence of the IDH1 mutation in vivo.

Title: Neuroimaging of spine tumors.
Abstract: Intramedullary, intradural/extramedullary, and extradural spine tumors comprise a wide range of neoplasms with an even wider range of clinical symptoms and prognostic features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), commonly used to evaluate the spine in patients presenting with pain, can further characterize lesions that may be encountered on other imaging studies, such as bone scintigraphy or computed tomography (CT). The advantage of the MRI is its multiplane capabilities, superior contrast agent resolution, and flexible protocols that play an important role in assessing tumor location, extent in directing biopsy, in planning proper therapy, and in evaluating therapeutic results. A multimodality approach can be used to fully characterize the lesion and the combination of information obtained from the different modalities usually narrows the diagnostic possibilities significantly. The diagnosis of spinal tumors is based on patient age, topographic features of the tumor, and lesion pattern, as seen at CT and MRI. The shift to high-end imaging incorporating diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, whole-body short tau inversion recovery, positron emission tomography, intraoperative and high-field MRI as part of the mainstream clinical imaging protocol has provided neurologists, neuro-oncologists, and neurosurgeons a window of opportunity to assess the biologic behavior of spine neoplasms. This chapter reviews neuroimaging of spine tumors, primary and secondary, discussing routine and newer modalities that can reduce the significant morbidity associated with these neoplasms.

Title: (13)C MRS and LC-MS Flux Analysis of Tumor Intermediary Metabolism.
Abstract: We present the first validated metabolic network model for analysis of flux through key pathways of tumor intermediary metabolism, including glycolysis, the oxidative and non-oxidative arms of the pentose pyrophosphate shunt, the TCA cycle as well as its anaplerotic pathways, pyruvate-malate shuttling, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation. The model that is called Bonded Cumomer Analysis for application to (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C MRS) data and Fragmented Cumomer Analysis for mass spectrometric data is a refined and efficient form of isotopomer analysis that can readily be expanded to incorporate glycogen, phospholipid, and other pathways thereby encompassing all the key pathways of tumor intermediary metabolism. Validation was achieved by demonstrating agreement of experimental measurements of the metabolic rates of oxygen consumption, glucose consumption, lactate production, and glutamate pool size with independent measurements of these parameters in cultured human DB-1 melanoma cells. These cumomer models have been applied to studies of DB-1 melanoma and DLCL2 human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells in culture and as xenografts in nude mice at 9.4 T. The latter studies demonstrate the potential translation of these methods to in situ studies of human tumor metabolism by MRS with stable (13)C isotopically labeled substrates on instruments operating at high magnetic fields (>/=7 T). The melanoma studies indicate that this tumor line obtains 51% of its ATP by mitochondrial metabolism and 49% by glycolytic metabolism under both euglycemic (5 mM glucose) and hyperglycemic conditions (26 mM glucose). While a high level of glutamine uptake is detected corresponding to ~50% of TCA cycle flux under hyperglycemic conditions, and ~100% of TCA cycle flux under euglycemic conditions, glutaminolysis flux and its contributions to ATP synthesis were very small. Studies of human lymphoma cells demonstrated that inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling produced changes in flux through the glycolytic, pentose shunt, and TCA cycle pathways that were evident within 8 h of treatment and increased at 24 and 48 h. Lactate was demonstrated to be a suitable biomarker of mTOR inhibition that could readily be monitored by (1)H MRS and perhaps also by FDG-PET and hyperpolarized (13)C MRS methods.

Title: Integrative Network-based Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Genome Wide Expression in Glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: The goal of this study was to identify correlations between metabolites from proton MR spectroscopy and genetic pathway activity in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Twenty patients with primary GBM were analysed by short echo-time chemical shift imaging and genome-wide expression analyses. Weighed Gene Co-Expression Analysis was used for an integrative analysis of imaging and genetic data. N-acetylaspartate, normalised to the contralateral healthy side (nNAA), was significantly correlated to oligodendrocytic and neural development. For normalised creatine (nCr), a group with low nCr was linked to the mesenchymal subtype, while high nCr could be assigned to the proneural subtype. Moreover, clustering of normalised glutamine and glutamate (nGlx) revealed two groups, one with high nGlx being attributed to the neural subtype, and one with low nGlx associated with the classical subtype. Hence, the metabolites nNAA, nCr, and nGlx correlate with a specific gene expression pattern reflecting the previously described subtypes of GBM. Moreover high nNAA was associated with better clinical prognosis, whereas patients with lower nNAA revealed a shorter progression-free survival (PFS).

Title: Development of a transplantable glioma tumour model from genetically engineered mice: MRI/MRS/MRSI characterisation.
Abstract: The initial aim of this study was to generate a transplantable glial tumour model of low-intermediate grade by disaggregation of a spontaneous tumour mass from genetically engineered models (GEM). This should result in an increased tumour incidence in comparison to GEM animals. An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (OA) tumour of World Health Organization (WHO) grade III was obtained from a female GEM mouse with the S100beta-v-erbB/inK4a-Arf (+/-) genotype maintained in the C57BL/6 background. The tumour tissue was disaggregated; tumour cells from it were grown in aggregates and stereotactically injected into C57BL/6 mice. Tumour development was followed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), while changes in the metabolomics pattern of the masses were evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/Spectroscopic Imaging (MRS/MRSI). Final tumour grade was evaluated by histopathological analysis. The total number of tumours generated from GEM cells from disaggregated tumour (CDT) was 67 with up to 100 % penetrance, as compared to 16 % in the local GEM model, with an average survival time of 66 +/- 55 days, up to 4.3-fold significantly higher than the standard GL261 glioblastoma (GBM) tumour model. Tumours produced by transplantation of cells freshly obtained from disaggregated GEM tumour were diagnosed as WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma (ODG) and OA, while tumours produced from a previously frozen sample were diagnosed as WHO grade IV GBM. We successfully grew CDT and generated tumours from a grade III GEM glial tumour. Freezing and cell culture protocols produced progression to grade IV GBM, which makes the developed transplantable model qualify as potential secondary GBM model in mice.

Title: Membrane Disordering by Eicosapentaenoic Acid in B Lymphomas Is Reduced by Elongation to Docosapentaenoic Acid as Revealed with Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Model Membranes.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Plasma membrane organization is a mechanistic target of n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. Previous studies show that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) differentially disrupt plasma membrane molecular order to enhance the frequency and function of B lymphocytes. However, it is not known whether EPA and DHA affect the plasma membrane organization of B lymphomas differently to influence their function. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether EPA and DHA had different effects on membrane order in B lymphomas and liposomes and studied their effects on B-lymphoma growth. METHODS: B lymphomas were treated with 25 mumol EPA, DHA, or serum albumin control/L for 24 h. Membrane order was measured with fluorescence polarization, and cellular fatty acids (FAs) were analyzed with GC. Growth was quantified with a viability assay. (2)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies were conducted on deuterated phospholipid bilayers. RESULTS: Treating Raji, Ramos, and RPMI lymphomas for 24 h with 25 mumol EPA or DHA/L lowered plasma membrane order by 10-40% relative to the control. There were no differences between EPA and DHA on membrane order for the 3 cell lines. FA analyses revealed complex changes in response to EPA or DHA treatment and a large fraction of EPA was converted to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5n-3). NMR studies, which were used to understand why EPA and DHA had similiar membrane effects, showed that phospholipids containing DPA, similar to DHA, were more ordered than those containing EPA. Finally, treating B lymphomas with 25 mumol EPA or DHA/L did not increase the frequency of B lymphomas compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results establish that 25 mumol EPA and DHA/L equally disrupt membrane order and do not promote B lymphoma growth. The data open a new area of investigation, which is how EPA's conversion to DPA substantially moderates its influence on membrane properties.

Title: Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells. RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level.

Title: Neuronavigation-assisted trajectory planning for deep brain biopsy with susceptibility-weighted imaging.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) exploits susceptibility differences between tissues to enhance contrast in magnetic resonance imaging to enable the visualization of small blood vessels that are difficult to detect by other contrast agents. This study explored the value of SWI-based planning for neuronavigation-guided deep brain biopsies to reduce the incidence of post-surgical complications. METHODS: The cohort of 84 patients was divided into 41 biopsies performed aided by SWI (SWI group) and 43 biopsies based on conventional T1w-Gd-based imaging (T1w-Gd group). Biopsy targets were determined using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before the operation, and the safest trajectory was selected based on preoperative images of blood vessels. RESULTS: Within 24 h of surgery, there was no radiographically identified bleeding, no blood extravasation and no clinical intracranial hypertension in the SWI group. Only one patient (2.5 %) with basal ganglia lymphoma developed transient hemiparesis after biopsy, who later recovered after undergoing symptomatic treatment. Complication rates in the SWI group were lower than in the T1w-Gd group, where a 7 % morbidity rate was encountered with one patient developing a permanent neurological deficit and two showing biopsy-associated hemorrhages. SWI imaging yielded a better visualization of subcortical vessels and deep-seated brain structures. CONCLUSIONS: SWI-based imaging revealed significantly better visualization of small-caliber vasculature that was not detectable on conventional T1w-Gd imaging, minimizing damage to the brain and reducing postoperative complications. Furthermore, MRS can contribute significantly to target selection to improve the yield of image-guided biopsies.

Title: Diagnostic value of glutamate with 2-hydroxyglutarate in magnetic resonance spectroscopy for IDH1 mutant glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene that are frequently observed in low-grade glioma are strongly associated with the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which is a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of IDH1 mutant glioma. However, conventional MR spectroscopy (MRS)-based noninvasive detection of 2HG is challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine the additional value of other metabolites in predicting IDH1 mutations with conventional MRS. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with glioma underwent conventional single voxel short echo time MRS prior to surgery. A stereotactic navigation-guided operation was performed to resect tumor tissues in the center of the MRS voxel. MRS-based measurements of metabolites were validated with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also conducted integrated analyses of glioma cell lines and clinical samples to examine the other metabolite levels and molecular findings in IDH1 mutant gliomas. RESULTS: A metabolomic analysis demonstrated higher levels of 2HG in IDH1 mutant glioma cells and surgical tissues. Interestingly, glutamate levels were significantly decreased in IDH1 mutant gliomas. Through an analysis of metabolic enzyme genes in glutamine pathways, it was shown that the expressions of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 were reduced and glutamate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in IDH1 mutant gliomas. Conventional MRS detection of glutamate and 2HG resulted in a high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 72%, specificity 96%) for IDH1 mutant glioma. CONCLUSIONS: IDH1 mutations alter glutamate metabolism. Combining glutamate levels optimizes the 2HG-based monitoring of IDH1 mutations via MRS and represents a reliable clinical application for diagnosing IDH1 mutant gliomas.

Title: Mutant IDH1 expression is associated with down-regulation of monocarboxylate transporters.
Abstract: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are characteristic of low-grade gliomas. We recently showed that mutant IDH1 cells reprogram cellular metabolism by down-regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Reduced pyruvate metabolism via PDH could lead to increased pyruvate conversion to lactate. The goal of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of the IDH1 mutation on the pyruvate-to-lactate flux. We used 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and compared the conversion of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate to [1-13C]-lactate in immortalized normal human astrocytes expressing mutant or wild-type IDH1 (NHAIDHmut and NHAIDHwt). Our results indicate that hyperpolarized lactate production is reduced in NHAIDHmut cells compared to NHAIDHwt. This reduction was associated with lower expression of the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 in NHAIDHmut cells. Furthermore, hyperpolarized lactate production was comparable in lysates of NHAIDHmut and NHAIDHwt cells, wherein MCTs do not impact hyperpolarized pyruvate delivery and lactate production. Collectively, our findings indicated that lower MCT expression was a key contributor to lower hyperpolarized lactate production in NHAIDHmut cells. The SLC16A3 (MCT4) promoter but not SLC16A1 (MCT1) promoter was hypermethylated in NHAIDHmut cells, pointing to possibly different mechanisms mediating reduced MCT expression. Finally analysis of low-grade glioma patient biopsy data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that MCT1 and MCT4 expression was significantly reduced in mutant IDH1 tumors compared to wild-type. Taken together, our study shows that reduced MCT expression is part of the metabolic reprogramming of mutant IDH1 gliomas. This finding could impact treatment and has important implications for metabolic imaging of mutant IDH1 gliomas.

Title: Evaluation of intracranial neoplasia and noninfectious meningoencephalitis in dogs by use of short echo time, single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3.0 Tesla.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE To investigate metabolite concentrations of the brains of dogs with intracranial neoplasia or noninfectious meningoencephalitis by use of short echo time, single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) at 3.0 T. ANIMALS 29 dogs with intracranial lesions (14 with neoplasia [3 oligodendromas, 3 glioblastomas multiformes, 3 astrocytomas, 2 lymphomas, and 3 meningiomas] and 15 is with noninfectious meningoencephalitis) and 10 healthy control dogs. PROCEDURES Short echo time, single voxel (1)H-MRS at 3.0 T was performed on neoplastic and noninfectious inflammatory intracranial lesions identified with conventional MRI. Metabolites of interest included N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total choline, creatine, myoinositol, the glutamine-glutamate complex (Glx), glutathione, taurine, lactate, and lipids. Data were analyzed with postprocessing fitting algorithm software. Metabolite concentrations relative to brain water content were calculated and compared with results for the healthy control dogs, which had been previously evaluated with the same (1)H MRS technique. RESULTS NAA, creatine, and Glx concentrations were reduced in the brains of dogs with neoplasia and noninfectious meningoencephalitis, whereas choline concentration was increased. Concentrations of these metabolites differed significantly between dogs with neoplasia and dogs with noninfectious meningoencephalitis. Concentrations of NAA, creatine, and Glx were significantly lower in dogs with neoplasia, whereas the concentration of choline was significantly higher in dogs with neoplasia. Lipids were predominantly found in dogs with high-grade intra-axial neoplasia, meningioma, and necrotizing meningoencephalitis. A high concentration of taurine was found in 10 of 15 dogs with noninfectious meningoencephalitis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE (1)H MRS provided additional metabolic information about intracranial neoplasia and noninfectious meningoencephalitis in dogs.

Title: Rare Parenchyma Meningioma in an Adolescent Female With Cheek Tingling: A Case Report.
Abstract: The following is a report on a rare parenchyma meningioma and the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. To our knowledge, this was the first characterization of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in a parenchyma meningioma. Three days after initial presentation, a 14-year-old female student reported feeling tingling in her cheek, grading 3 to 4 points. Two hours later, the tingling had disappeared. The patient was admitted to hospital with stable vital signs and no abnormal presentations upon physical examination. A routine CT scan of the brain showed a quasicircular region of the left occipital lobe was homogenous hyperdense and an arcualia calcification was found on the lesion's margin and the boundary was ill-defined. Further MRI and contrast-enhanced scanning of the brain showed that a lobulated nidus with abnormal signaling was present in the left occipital lobe and was approximately 1.9 x 2.0 cm. Hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging and a slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging was also observed. A short T2 signal appeared on the margin and a few longer T2 edema zones appeared around the nidus, whereas the lesion showed homogenous enhancement. MRS was characterized by a slight or moderate increase of a choline (Cho) peak and a small reduction of the N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peak. After completing the preoperative preparation, the excision of the supratentorial deep lesions was performed on the patient. The pathology led to a diagnosis of a left occipital lobe meningioma, WHO I. The patient was followed-up for 14 months postoperation, and had no reoccurrences. Intraparenchymal meningioma rarely occurs in brain parenchyma, and is characterized by lesions with abundant blood supply and requires a glioma to be identified. MRS is a potential tool for preoperative diagnosis of intraparenchymal meningioma.

Title: Relationship between Apparent Diffusion Coefficients and MR Spectroscopy Findings in High-Grade Gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for preoperative grading and treatment planning of high-grade gliomas (HGG) is still debated since the assumption of inverse correlation between ADC and cellularity is not completely coherent with the results of some studies. It has been recently hypothesized that restricted diffusivity in HGG may be related to hypoxic/ischemic changes inside the tumor. We therefore investigated the differences of ADC values between areas with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) markers of hypoxia and necrosis (lactate and lipid compounds) and regions with lack of both metabolites. METHODS: The MRS datasets and the corresponding ADC maps of 28 patients with HGG were retrospectively reviewed. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on ADC maps by means of spectral characteristics, considering the solid portions of gliomas. One-way ANOVA or Welch test were performed for multiple comparison of the Mean ADC, minimum ADC (minADC), and standard deviation of pixel-by-pixel ADC measurements (ADC SD) values among the groups of ROIs with lactate, lipids, and lack of both metabolites (LAC, LIP, and NEG group, respectively). RESULTS: The minADC values in LAC group (908 +/- 161 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) ) were found to be significantly (P = .03) higher than in NEG group (792 +/- 122 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) ). We did not find other significant differences by the multiple comparison tests. CONCLUSIONS: HGG areas with MRS markers of hypoxia and necrosis are not associated with restricted diffusivity. To explain the trend to diffusion facilitation in HGG lactate-expressing regions, we hypothesize a possible hypoxia-induced volume reduction of glioma cells with extracellular shift of cytoplasmic water.

Title: Usefulness of quantitative peritumoural perfusion and proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging evaluation in differentiating brain gliomas from solitary brain metastases.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether peritumoural perfusion weighted and proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging can be used in differentiating between primary gliomas and solitary metastases. METHODS: Ten low-grade gliomas, eight high-grade gliomas and 10 metastases were prospectively evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced perfusion imaging and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy before surgical resection or stereotactic biopsy. Maximal relative cerebral blood volume values were calculated drawing three regions of interest of 2 cm(2) in the non-enhancing peritumoural areas. Maximal relative cerebral blood volume values were normalised to that of contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Maximal choline/creatine ratios were calculated from three voxels of 10 cm(3) placed in the peritumoural areas defined as non-enhancing peritumoural white matter surrounding the tumour. The tumour grade presumed with these values was compared to histopathological grading. Differences in the study parameters between groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine cut-off values. RESULTS: A clear relative cerebral blood volume cut-off value of 1.88 was detected for differentiating low-grade gliomas from high-grade gliomas. A clear relative cerebral blood volume cut-off value of 1.20 was detected for differentiation of metastases from gliomas. The differences in the choline/creatine ratios in the peritumoural regions of high-grade gliomas and of solitary metastasis were statistically significant (P < 0.001) but a clear cut-off value was not found. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that peritumoural perfusion-weighted imaging can assist in preoperative differentiation between a glioma and a solitary metastasis.

Title: Metabonomic signature analysis in plasma samples of glioma patients based on (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The presence of a glioma is associated with increasing mortality. In this study, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabonomics has been applied to investigate the metabolic signatures of a glioma in plasma. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic potential of this approach and gain novel insights into the metabolism of glioma and its systemic effects. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected prospectively by centrifugation of blood samples from patients with a glioma (n = 70) or a control group (n = 70). NMR spectra of these plasma samples were analyzed using orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify the potential biomarkers. RESULTS: The OPLS-DA model showed a good differentiation between the glioma and the control groups. A total of 20 metabolites were identified, which are closely correlating with the presence of a glioma. Compared to the control group, patients with a glioma were associated with lower concentrations of isoleucine, leucine, valine, lactate, alanine, glycoprotein, glutamate, citrate, creatine, myo-inositol, choline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, 1-methylhistidine, alpha-glucose, beta-glucose, and higher concentrations of very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein (LDL), unsaturated lipid, and pyruvate. These 20 metabolites, which are involved in energy, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism, may be associated with a human glioma. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first one to identify the plasma metabolites that have the potential to distinguish between patients with a glioma and healthy subjects. NMR-based metabonomics provides a good sensitivity and selectivity in differentiating the healthy control group from patients suffering form the disease. Plasma metabolic profiling may have a potential in diagnosing a glioma in the early phase and may help in enhancing our understanding of its underlying mechanisms.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Methods for Detecting Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2 Mutations and Their Metabolic Consequence, 2-Hydroxyglutarate, in Different Neoplasms.
Abstract: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations have been recognized in a few neoplasms including glioma, acute myeloid leukemia, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The direct methods to detect IDH mutations include DNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or by measuring its byproduct, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), in the blood or urine. Moreover, conventional magnetic resonance imaging can be modified to magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure 2-HG in tumor. By conducting a search in Medline/PubMed and ISI/Web of Science for the published articles in English related to the methods for detection of IDH mutations and its byproduct 2-HG, we compared different methodologies to detect these mutations and discuss advantages and limitations of each method. Studies in which a methodology of detection was compared with another modality were included. Multiple studies have shown that both DNA sequencing and IHC are reliable methods for detecting IDH mutations in glioma and other solid neoplasms. IHC appeared to be less costly, easier to perform, and may be slightly more accurate than DNA sequencing. 2-HG has also been measured in bone marrow aspirate, serum and urine of patients with mutant IDH acute myeloid leukemia, and correlated very well with sequencing and IHC. Lastly, in some glioma patients, MRS detected IDH mutations noninvasively and reliably with excellent correlations with other modalities such as IHC and sequencing. In conclusion, IHC, MRS, and 2-HG detection all are clinically useful and comparable with DNA sequencing in identifying IDH mutations in different neoplasms. 2-HG and MRS can be utilized for monitoring treatment response in a variety of neoplasms.

Title: MR Studies of Glioblastoma Models Treated with Dual PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor and Temozolomide:Metabolic Changes Are Associated with Enhanced Survival.
Abstract: The current standard of care for glioblastoma (GBM) is surgical resection, radiotherapy, and treatment with temozolomide (TMZ). However, resistance to current therapies and recurrence are common. To improve survival, agents that target the PI3K signaling pathway, which is activated in approximately 88% of GBM, are currently in clinical trials. A challenge with such therapies is that tumor shrinkage is not always observed. New imaging methods are therefore needed to monitor response to therapy and predict survival. The goal of this study was to determine whether hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to monitor response to the second-generation dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor voxtalisib (XL765, SAR245409), alone or in combination with TMZ. We investigated GS-2 and U87-MG GBM orthotopic tumors in mice, and used MRI, hyperpolarized (13)C MRSI, and (1)H MRS to monitor the effects of treatment. In our study, (1)H MRS could not predict tumor response to therapy. However, in both our models, we observed a significantly lower hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in animals treated with voxtalisib, TMZ, or combination therapy, when compared with controls. This metabolic alteration was observed prior to MRI-detectable changes in tumor size, was consistent with drug action, and was associated with enhanced animal survival. Our findings confirm the potential translational value of the hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio as a biomarker for noninvasively assessing the effects of emerging therapies for patients with GBM.

Title: Alteration of phospholipids in the blood of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): in vitro, high resolution (31)P NMR-based study.
Abstract: In vitro, high-resolution (31)P NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy-based analysis of phospholipids in serum is well recognized in leukemia, lymphoma, non-hematological cancers and renal cell carcinoma. In context of these studies, phospholipids were analyzed in blood of thirty-two (n = 32) patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (Age, Mean +/- SD; 8.0 +/- 1.6 years) and sixteen (n = 16) healthy subjects (Age, Mean +/- SD; 8.6 +/- 2.3 years). Quantity of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (Lys-PC) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in DMD patients as compared to healthy subjects. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) observed for the quantity of phospholipids in blood of gene deletion positive cases of DMD as compared to negative gene deletion cases of DMD. Quantity of phospholipids in negative gene deletion cases of DMD patients as well as DMD cases with positive gene deletion was significantly higher (p < 0.05) as compared to normal individuals. The present study distinguishes the patients with DMD from the healthy subjects on the basis of the quantity of phospholipids in blood. These observations may be useful in future for the development of new diagnostic method of DMD.

Title: Pseudotumoral presentation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical and radiologic features that should raise suspicion for the pseudotumoral presentation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-I). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the characteristics of 5 newly diagnosed and 23 previously reported patients in whom the CAA-I imaging findings were initially interpreted as CNS neoplasms. RESULTS: Most cases (85%) occurred in patients >60 years old. The clinical characteristics at presentation included subacute cognitive decline (50%), confusion (32%), focal deficits (32%), seizures (25%), and headaches (21%). Brain MRI demonstrated infiltrative white matter lesions that exhibited a loco-regional mass effect without parenchymal enhancement (93%). In general, these findings were interpreted as low-grade glioma or lymphoma. Eighteen patients (64%) underwent a biopsy, which was nondiagnostic in 4 patients (14%), and 6 patients (21%) underwent a surgical resection. The primary reason for the misinterpretation of the imaging findings was the absence of T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (T2*-GRE) sequences on initial imaging (89%). When subsequently performed (39%), the T2*-GRE sequences demonstrated multiple characteristic cortical and subcortical microhemorrhages in all cases. Perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which were performed on a subset of patients, indicated markedly reduced relative cerebral blood flow and a normal metabolic ratio. CONCLUSION: The identification of one or several nonenhancing space-occupying lesions, especially in elderly patients presenting with cognitive impairment, should raise suspicion for the pseudotumoral presentation of CAA-I and lead to T2*-GRE sequences. Perfusion MRI and MRS appear to be useful techniques for the differential diagnosis of this entity.

Title: Separation and quantification of lactate and lipid at 1.3 ppm by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To separate the spectrally overlapped lactate and lipid signals at 1.3 ppm using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) based on their large diffusivity difference. METHODS: DW-MRS was applied to the gel phantoms containing lactate and lipid droplets, and to the rat brain tumors. Lactate and lipid signals and their apparent diffusion coefficients were computed from the diffusion-weighted proton spectra. Biexponential fitting and direct spectral subtraction approaches were employed and compared. RESULTS: DW-MRS could effectively separate lactate and lipid signals both in phantoms and rat brain C6 glioma by biexponential fitting. In phantoms, lactate and lipid signals highly correlated with the known lactate concentration and lipid volume fractions. In C6 glioma, both lactate and lipid signals were detected, and the lipid signal was an order of magnitude higher than lactate signal. The spectral subtraction approach using three diffusion weightings also allowed the separation of lactate and lipid signals, yielding results comparable to those by the biexponential fitting approach. CONCLUSION: DW-MRS presents a new approach to separate and quantify spectrally overlapped molecules and/or macromolecules, such as lactate and lipid, by using the diffusivity difference associated with their different sizes or mobility within tissue microstructure.

Title: On the Utility of Short Echo Time (TE) Single Voxel 1H-MRS in Non-Invasive Detection of 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG); Challenges and Potential Improvement Illustrated with Animal Models Using MRUI and LCModel.
Abstract: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) are frequently found in brain tumors, and the resulting onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), has been suggested to be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of the diseases. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of non-invasively detecting 2HG by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Due to severe spectral overlaps of 2HG with its background metabolites and spectral baselines, however, the majority of those previous studies employed spectral editing methods with long echo times (TEs) instead of the most commonly used short TE approach with spectral fitting. Consequently, the results obtained with spectral editing methods may potentially be prone to errors resulting from substantial signal loss due to relaxation. Given that the spectral region where the main signal of 2HG resides is particularly sensitive to spectral baseline in metabolite quantification, we have investigated the impact of incorporating voxel-specifically measured baselines into the spectral basis set on the performance of the conventional short TE approach in 2HG detection in rodent models (Fisher 344 rats; n = 19) of IDH1/2 mutant-overexpressing F98 glioma at 9.4T. Metabolite spectra were acquired (SPECIAL sequence) for a tumor region and the contralateral normal region of the brain for each animal. For the estimation of spectral baselines metabolite-nulled spectra were obtained (double-inversion-recovery SPECIAL sequence) for each individual voxels. Data were post-processed with and without the measured baselines using MRUI and LCModel-the two most widely used data post-processing packages. Our results demonstrate that in-vivo detection of 2HG using the conventional short TE approach is challenging even at 9.4T. However, incorporation of voxel-specifically measured spectral baselines may potentially improve its performance. Upon more thorough validation in a larger number of animals and more importantly in human patients, the potential utility of the proposed short TE acquisition with voxel-specific baseline measurement approach in 2HG detection may need to be considered in the study design.

Title: Lactate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (LATEST) Imaging in vivo A Biomarker for LDH Activity.
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of lactate is of enormous significance in cancer and metabolic disorders where glycolysis dominates. Here, for the first time, we describe a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method (LATEST), based on the exchange between lactate hydroxyl proton and bulk water protons to image lactate with high spatial resolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of imaging lactate with LATEST in lactate phantoms under physiological conditions, in a mouse model of lymphoma tumors, and in skeletal muscle of healthy human subjects pre- and post-exercise. The method is validated by measuring LATEST changes in lymphoma tumors pre- and post-infusion of pyruvate and correlating them with lactate determined from multiple quantum filtered proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SEL-MQC (1)H-MRS). Similarly, dynamic LATEST changes in exercising human skeletal muscle are correlated with lactate determined from SEL-MQC (1)H-MRS. The LATEST method does not involve injection of radioactive isotopes or labeled metabolites. It has over two orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to conventional (1)H-MRS. It is anticipated that this technique will have a wide range of applications including diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic response of cancer, diabetes, cardiac, and musculoskeletal diseases. The advantages of LATEST over existing methods and its potential challenges are discussed.

Title: Optimal differentiation of high- and low-grade glioma and metastasis: a meta-analysis of perfusion, diffusion, and spectroscopy metrics.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To perform a meta-analysis of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metrics, including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC), and spectroscopy ratios choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) and choline/N-acetyl aspartate (Cho/NAA), for the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG) and metastases (MTS). METHODS: For systematic review, 83 articles (dated 2000-2013) were selected from the NCBI database. Twenty-four, twenty-two, and eight articles were included respectively for spectroscopy, rCBV, and nADC meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, we calculated overall means for rCBV, nADC, Cho/Cr (short TE-from 20 to 35 ms, medium-from 135 to 144 ms), and Cho/NAA for the HGG, LGG, and MTS groups. We used random effects model to obtain weighted averages and select thresholds. RESULTS: Overall means (with 95% CI) for rCBV, nADC, Cho/Cr (short and medium echo time, TE), and Cho/NAA were: for HGG 5.47 (4.78-6.15), 1.38 (1.16-1.60), 2.40 (1.67-3.13), 3.27 (2.78-3.77), and 4.71 (3.24-6.19); for LGG 2.00 (1.71-2.28), 1.61 (1.36-1.87), 1.46 (1.20-1.72), 1.71 (1.49-1.93), and 2.36 (1.50-3.23); for MTS 5.06 (3.85-6.27), 1.35 (1.06-1.64), 1.89 (1.72-2.06), 3.14 (1.57-4.72), (Cho/NAA was not available). LGG had significantly lower rCBV, Cho/Cr, and Cho/NAA values than HGG or MTS. No significant differences were found for nADC. CONCLUSIONS: Best differentiation between HGG and LGG is obtained from rCBV, Cho/Cr, and Cho/NAA metrics. MTS could not be reliably distinguished from HGG by the methods investigated.

Title: Integration of 2-hydroxyglutarate-proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy into clinical practice for disease monitoring in isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The majority of WHO grades II and III gliomas harbor a missense mutation in the metabolic gene isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and accumulate the metabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG). Prior studies showed that this metabolite can be detected in vivo using proton magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (MRS), but the sensitivity of this methodology and its clinical implications are unknown. METHODS: We developed an MR imaging protocol to integrate 2HG-MRS into routine clinical glioma imaging and examined its performance in 89 consecutive glioma patients. RESULTS: Detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in IDH-mutant gliomas was closely linked to tumor volume, with sensitivity ranging from 8% for small tumors (<3.4 mL) to 91% for larger tumors (>8 mL). In patients undergoing 2HG-MRS prior to surgery, tumor levels of 2HG corresponded with tumor cellularity but not with tumor grade or mitotic index. Cytoreductive therapy resulted in a gradual decrease in 2HG levels with kinetics that closely mirrored changes in tumor volume. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that 2HG-MRS can be linked with routine MR imaging to provide quantitative measurements of 2HG in glioma and may be useful as an imaging biomarker to monitor the abundance of IDH-mutant tumor cells noninvasively during glioma therapy and disease monitoring.

Title: Metabolic approach for tumor delineation in glioma surgery: 3D MR spectroscopy image-guided resection.
Abstract: OBJECT The extent of resection is one of the most essential factors that influence the outcomes of glioma resection. However, conventional structural imaging has failed to accurately delineate glioma margins because of tumor cell infiltration. Three-dimensional proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) can provide metabolic information and has been used in preoperative tumor differentiation, grading, and radiotherapy planning. Resection based on glioma metabolism information may provide for a more extensive resection and yield better outcomes for glioma patients. In this study, the authors attempt to integrate 3D (1)H-MRS into neuronavigation and assess the feasibility and validity of metabolically based glioma resection. METHODS Choline (Cho)-N-acetylaspartate (NAA) index (CNI) maps were calculated and integrated into neuronavigation. The CNI thresholds were quantitatively analyzed and compared with structural MRI studies. Glioma resections were performed under 3D (1)H-MRS guidance. Volumetric analyses were performed for metabolic and structural images from a low-grade glioma (LGG) group and high-grade glioma (HGG) group. Magnetic resonance imaging and neurological assessments were performed immediately after surgery and 1 year after tumor resection. RESULTS Fifteen eligible patients with primary cerebral gliomas were included in this study. Three-dimensional (1)H-MRS maps were successfully coregistered with structural images and integrated into navigational system. Volumetric analyses showed that the differences between the metabolic volumes with different CNI thresholds were statistically significant (p < 0.05). For the LGG group, the differences between the structural and the metabolic volumes with CNI thresholds of 0.5 and 1.5 were statistically significant (p = 0.0005 and 0.0129, respectively). For the HGG group, the differences between the structural and metabolic volumes with CNI thresholds of 0.5 and 1.0 were statistically significant (p = 0.0027 and 0.0497, respectively). All patients showed no tumor progression at the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This study integrated 3D MRS maps and intraoperative navigation for glioma margin delineation. Optimum CNI thresholds were applied for both LGGs and HGGs to achieve resection. The results indicated that 3D (1)H-MRS can be integrated with structural imaging to provide better outcomes for glioma resection.

Title: Hepatitis C virus-associated neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders: Advances in 2015.
Abstract: Since its identification in 1989, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a worldwide health problem with roughly 185 million chronic infections, representing individuals at high risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. In addition to being a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality due to liver disease, HCV has emerged as an important trigger of lymphoproliferative disorders, owing to its lymphotropism, and of a wide spectrum of extra-hepatic manifestations (HCV-EHMs) affecting different organ systems. The most frequently observed HCV-EHMs include mixed cryoglobulinemia and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nephropathies, thyreopathies, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and several neurological conditions. In addition, neuropsychiatric disorders and neurocognitive dysfunction are reported in nearly 50% of patients with chronic HCV infection, which are independent of the severity of liver disease or HCV replication rates. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression and reduced quality of life are commonly associated with neurocognitive alterations in patients with non-cirrhotic chronic HCV infection, regardless of the stage of liver fibrosis and the infecting genotype. These manifestations, which are the topic of this review, typically occur in the absence of structural brain damage or signal abnormalities on conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although metabolic and microstructural changes can be detected by in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, perfusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI, and neurophysiological tests of cognitive processing. Several lines of evidence, including comparative and longitudinal neuropsychological assessments in patients achieving spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance, support a major pathogenic role for HCV in neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders.

Title: Novel application of chemical shift gradient echo in- and opposed-phase sequences in 3 T MRI for the detection of H-MRS visible lipids and grading of glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the feasibility of using chemical shift gradient-echo (GE) in- and opposed-phase (IOP) imaging to grade glioma. METHODS: A phantom study was performed to investigate the correlation of (1)H MRS-visible lipids with the signal loss ratio (SLR) obtained using IOP imaging. A cross-sectional study approved by the institutional review board was carried out in 22 patients with different glioma grades. The patients underwent scanning using IOP imaging and single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) using 3T MRI. The brain spectra acquisitions from solid and cystic components were obtained and correlated with the SLR for different grades. RESULTS: The phantom study showed a positive linear correlation between lipid quantification at 0.9 parts per million (ppm) and 1.3 ppm with SLR (r = 0.79-0.99, p < 0.05). In the clinical study, we found that SLR at the solid portions was the best measure for differentiating glioma grades using optimal cut-points of 0.064 and 0.086 with classification probabilities for grade II (SII = 1), grade III (SIII = 0.50) and grade IV (SIV = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the lipid quantification differences in grades of glioma and provide a more comprehensive characterization by using SLR in chemical shift GE IOP imaging. SLR in IOP sequence demonstrates good performance in glioma grading. KEY POINTS: * Strong correlation was seen between lipid concentration and SLR obtained using IOP * IOP sequence demonstrates significant differences in signal loss within the glioma grades * SLR at solid tumour portions was the best measure for differentiation * This sequence is applicable in a research capacity for glioma staging armamentarium.

Title: Treatment Response Assessment in IDH-Mutant Glioma Patients by Noninvasive 3D Functional Spectroscopic Mapping of 2-Hydroxyglutarate.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Measurements of objective response rates are critical to evaluate new glioma therapies. The hallmark metabolic alteration in gliomas with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is the overproduction of oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which plays a key role in malignant transformation. 2HG represents an ideal biomarker to probe treatment response in IDH-mutant glioma patients, and we hypothesized a decrease in 2HG levels would be measureable by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a result of antitumor therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We report a prospective longitudinal imaging study performed in 25 IDH-mutant glioma patients receiving adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. A newly developed 3D MRS imaging was used to noninvasively image 2HG. Paired Student t test was used to compare pre- and posttreatment tumor 2HG values. Test-retest measurements were performed to determine the threshold for 2HG functional spectroscopic maps (fSM). Univariate and multivariate regression were performed to correlate 2HG changes with Karnofsky performance score (KPS). RESULTS: We found that mean 2HG (2HG/Cre) levels decreased significantly (median = 48.1%; 95% confidence interval = 27.3%-56.5%;P= 0.007) in the posttreatment scan. The volume of decreased 2HG correlates (R(2)= 0.88,P= 0.002) with clinical status evaluated by KPS. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that dynamic measurements of 2HG are feasible by 3D fSM, and the decrease of 2HG levels can monitor treatment response in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. Our results indicate that quantitative in vivo 2HG imaging may be used for precision medicine and early response assessment in clinical trials of therapies targeting IDH-mutant gliomas.

Title: The role of imaging in the management of adults with diffuse low grade glioma: A systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline.
Abstract: QUESTION: What is the optimal imaging technique to be used in the diagnosis of a suspected low grade glioma, specifically: which anatomic imaging sequences are critical for most accurately identifying or diagnosing a low grade glioma (LGG) and do non-anatomic imaging methods and/or sequences add to the diagnostic specificity of suspected low grade gliomas? TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with a newly diagnosed lesion with a suspected or histopathologically proven LGG. LEVEL II: In patients with a suspected brain tumor, the minimum magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam should be an anatomic exam with both T2 weighted and pre- and post-gadolinium contrast enhanced T1 weighted imaging. CRITICAL IMAGING FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF LOW GRADE GLIOMA: LEVEL II: In patients with a suspected brain tumor, anatomic imaging sequences should include T1 and T2 weighted and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MR sequences and will include T1 weighted imaging after the administration of gadolinium based contrast. Computed tomography (CT) can provide additional information regarding calcification or hemorrhage, which may narrow the differential diagnosis. At a minimum, these anatomic sequences can help identify a lesion as well as its location, and potential for surgical intervention. IMPROVEMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC SPECIFICITY WITH THE ADDITION OF NON-ANATOMIC (PHYSIOLOGIC AND ADVANCED IMAGING) TO ANATOMIC IMAGING: LEVEL II: Class II evidence from multiple studies and a significant number of Class III series support the addition of diffusion and perfusion weighted MR imaging in the assessment of suspected LGGs, for the purposes of discriminating the potential for tumor subtypes and identification of suspicion of higher grade diagnoses. LEVEL III: Multiple series offer Class III evidence to support the potential for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and nuclear medicine methods including positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging to offer additional diagnostic specificity although these are less well defined and their roles in clinical practice are still being defined. QUESTION: Which imaging sequences or parameters best predict the biological behavior or prognosis for patients with LGG? TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with a newly diagnosed lesion with a suspected or histopathologically proven LGG. RECOMMENDATION: Anatomic and advanced imaging methods and prognostic stratification LEVEL III: Multiple series suggest a role for anatomic and advanced sequences to suggest prognostic stratification among low grade gliomas. Perfusion weighted imaging, particularly when obtained as a part of diagnostic evaluation (as recommended above) can play a role in consideration of prognosis. Other imaging sequences remain investigational in terms of their role in consideration of tumor prognosis as there is insufficient evidence to support more formal recommendations as to their use at this time. QUESTION: What is the optimal imaging technique to be used in the follow-up of a suspected (or biopsy proven) LGG? TARGET POPULATION: This recommendation applies to adults with a newly diagnosed low grade glioma. LEVEL II: In patients with a diagnosis of LGG, anatomic imaging sequences should include T2/FLAIR MR sequences and T1 weighted imaging before and after the administration of gadolinium based contrast. Serial imaging should be performed to identify new areas of contrast enhancement or significant change in tumor size, which may signify transformation to a higher grade. LEVEL III: Advanced imaging utility may depend on tumor subtype. Multicenter clinical trials with larger cohorts are needed. For astrocytic tumors, baseline and longitudinal elevations in tumor perfusion as assessed by dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI are associated with shorter time to tumor progression, but can be difficult to standardize in clinical practice. For oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas, MRS may be helpful for identification of progression.

Title: The diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in differentiating high-from low-grade gliomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a powerful tool for preoperative grading of gliomas. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRS in differentiating high-grade gliomas (HGGs) from low-grade gliomas (LGGs). METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched for relevant studies of glioma grading assessed by MRS through 27 March 2015. Based on the data from eligible studies, pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio and areas under summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) of different metabolite ratios were obtained. RESULTS: Thirty articles comprising a total sample size of 1228 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Quantitative synthesis of studies showed that the pooled sensitivity/specificity of Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr ratios was 0.75/0.60, 0.80/0.76 and 0.71/0.70, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of the SROC was 0.83, 0.87 and 0.78, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MRS demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance in distinguishing HGGs from LGGs using tumoural metabolite ratios including Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr. Although there was no significant difference in AUC between Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA groups, Cho/NAA ratio showed higher sensitivity and specificity than Cho/Cr ratio and NAA/Cr ratio. We suggest that MRS should combine other advanced imaging techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy in differentiating HGGs from LGGs. KEY POINTS: * MRS has moderate diagnostic performance in distinguishing HGGs from LGGs. * There is no significant difference in AUC between Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. * Cho/NAA ratio is superior to NAA/Cr ratio. * Cho/NAA ratio shows higher sensitivity and specificity than Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios. * MRS should combine other advanced imaging techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Title: The effect of neurosphere culture conditions on the cellular metabolism of glioma cells.
Abstract: Malignant gliomas, with an average survival time of 16-19 months after initial diagnosis, account for one of the most lethal tumours overall. Current standards in patient care provide only unsatisfying strategies in diagnostic and treatment for high-grade gliomas. Here we describe metabolic phenomena in the choline and glycine network associated with stem cell culture conditions in the classical glioma cell line U87. Using high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cell culture metabolic extracts we compare the metabolic composition of U87 chronically propagated as adherent culture in medium supplemented with serum to serum-free neurosphere growth. We found that the switch to neurosphere growth, besides the increase of cells expressing the putative glioma stem cell marker CD133, modulated a number of intracellular metabolites including choline, creatine, glycine, and myo-inositol that have been previously reported as potential diagnostic markers in various tumours. These findings highlight the critical influence of culture conditions on glioma cell metabolism, and therefore particular caution should be drawn to the use of in vitro system research in order to investigate cancer metabolism.

Title: Alterations in cellular metabolome after pharmacological inhibition of Notch in glioblastoma cells.
Abstract: Notch signaling can promote tumorigenesis in the nervous system and plays important roles in stem-like cancer cells. However, little is known about how Notch inhibition might alter tumor metabolism, particularly in lesions arising in the brain. The gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK003 was used to treat glioblastoma neurospheres, and they were subdivided into sensitive and insensitive groups in terms of canonical Notch target response. Global metabolomes were then examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and changes in intracellular concentration of various metabolites identified which correlate with Notch inhibition. Reductions in glutamate were verified by oxidation-based colorimetric assays. Interestingly, the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide, the mTOR-inhibitor MLN0128, and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 did not reduce glutamate levels, suggesting that changes to this metabolite might reflect specific downstream effects of Notch blockade in gliomas rather than general sequelae of tumor growth inhibition. Global and targeted expression analyses revealed that multiple genes important in glutamate homeostasis, including glutaminase, are dysregulated after Notch inhibition. Treatment with an allosteric inhibitor of glutaminase, compound 968, could slow glioblastoma growth, and Notch inhibition may act at least in part by regulating glutaminase and glutamate.

Title: Comparison between magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion weighted imaging in the evaluation of gliomas response after treatment.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in the assessment of progression and regression of brain tumors in order to assess whether there is correlation between MRS and DWI in the monitoring of patients with primary tumors after therapy. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been performed in 80 patients, 48 affected by high grade gliomas (HGG) and 32 affected by low grade gliomas (LGG). The variation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and metabolite ratios before and after treatment has been used to test DWI sequences and MRS as predictor to response to therapy. Comparison between post contrast-enhancement sequences, MRS and DWI has been done in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Moreover statistical correlation of ADC deviations with MRS metabolites variations before and after therapy have been studied. RESULTS: In the case of HGG, MRS shows better sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy compared to DWI, especially when considering the Choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) ratio. Regarding the LGG, the technique that better evaluates the response to treatment appears to be the DWI. A moderate correlation between ADC deviations and Cho, Lipide (Lip) and Lactate (Lac) has been found in LGG; while NAA revealed to be weakly correlated to ADC variation. Considering HGG, a weak correlation has been found between ADC deviations and MRS metabolites. CONCLUSION: Combination of DWI and MRS can help to characterize different changes related to treatment and to evaluate brain tumor response to treatment.

Title: Convex-Envelope Based Automated Quantitative Approach to Multi-Voxel 1H-MRS Applied to Brain Tumor Analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can measure in vivo brain tissue metabolism that exhibits unique biochemical characteristics in brain tumors. For clinical application, an efficient and versatile quantification method of MRS would be an important tool for medical research, particularly for exploring the scientific problem of tumor monitoring. The objective of our study is to propose an automated MRS quantitative approach and assess the feasibility of this approach for glioma grading, prognosis and boundary detection. METHODS: An automated quantitative approach based on a convex envelope (AQoCE) is proposed in this paper, including preprocessing, convex-envelope based baseline fitting, bias correction, sectional baseline removal, and peak detection, in a total of 5 steps. Some metabolic ratios acquired by this quantification are selected for statistical analysis. An independent sample t-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test are used for distinguishing low-grade gliomas (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG) and for detecting the tumor, peritumoral and contralateral areas, respectively. Seventy-eight cases of pre-operative brain gliomas with pathological reports are included in this study. RESULTS: Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr and Lip-Lac/Cr (LL/Cr) calculated by AQoCE in the tumor area differ significantly between LGG and HGG, with p</=0.005. Using logistic regression combining Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr and LL/Cr to generate a ROC curve, AQoCE achieves a sensitivity of 92.9%, a specificity of 72.2%, and an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.860. Moreover, both Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr in the AQoCE approach show a significant difference (p</=0.019) between tumoral, peritumoral, and contralateral areas. The comparison between the results of AQoCE and Siemens MRS processing software are also discussed in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: The AQoCE approach is an automated method of residual water removal and metabolite quantification. It can be applied to multi-voxel 1H-MRS for evaluating brain glioma grading and demonstrating characteristics of brain glioma metabolism. It can also detect infiltration in the peritumoral area. Under the limited clinical data used, AQoCE is significantly more versatile and efficient compared to the reference approach of Siemens.

Title: Dynamic 1H-MRS assessment of brain tumors: a novel approach for differential diagnosis of glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether the changes of [Cho/NAA] ratio in patients with glioma, measured by dynamic 1H-MRS can be used to differentiate between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained. Forty-nine patients with biopsy-proven glioma and 20 normal control subjects were recruited in this study. The maximum [Cho/NAA] ratios, acquired at 0 min, and at 6 min, were calculated and assessed from volume of interests (VOI) in the tumor areas and in the surrounding normal tissue for each patient. Absolute difference in the [Cho/NAA] ratios, from MRS acquired at 0 and 6 min, in high-grade glioma, low-grade glioma, and control subjects were compared. RESULTS: The maximum [Cho/NAA] ratio acquired from the tumor area at the 0 min is 6.08 +/- 2.02, which was significantly different (p = .017) from that acquired after 6 min, 4.87 +/- 2.13. The [Cho/NAA] ratio from the surrounding normal tissue area did not change significantly from spectra acquired at different times (0 min, 6 min). Absolute difference in [Cho/NAA] ratios acquired at 0 and 6 min time points were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in high-grade glioma (= 3.86 +/- 3.31) than in low-grade glioma (= 0.81 +/- 0.90), and control subjects (0.061 +/- 0.026, P = 0.000), while there was no significantly difference in low-grade glioma and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic 1H-MRS can be useful for differential diagnosis between high-grade and low-grade gliomas as well as insight into the heterogeneity within the tumor.

Title: Accurate grading of brain gliomas by soft independent modeling of class analogy based on non-negative matrix factorization of proton magnetic resonance spectra.
Abstract: Hydrogen magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) is a non-invasive technique which provides a 'frequency-signal intensity' spectrum of biochemical compounds of tissues in the body. Although this method is currently used in human brain studies, accurate classification of in-vivo (1) H-MRS is a challenging task in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Problems such as overlapping metabolite peaks, incomplete information on background component and low signal-to-noise ratio disturb classification results of this spectroscopic method. This study presents an alternative approach to the soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) technique, using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction. In the adopted strategy, the performance of SIMCA was improved by application of a robust algorithm for classification in the presence of noisy measurements. Total of 219 spectra from two databases were taken by water-suppressed short echo-time (1) H-MRS, acquired from different subjects with different stages of glial brain tumors (Grade II (26 cases), grade III (24 cases), grade IV (41 cases), as well as 25 healthy cases). The SIMCA was performed using two approaches: (i) principal component analysis (PCA) and (ii) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), as a modified approach. Square prediction error was considered to assess the class membership of the external validation set. Finally, several figures of merit such as the correct classification rate (CCR), sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results of SIMCA based on NMF showed significant improvement in percentage of correctly classified samples, 91.4% versus 83.5% for PCA-based model in an independent test set.

Title: Gene mutation profiling of primary glioblastoma through multiple tumor biopsy guided by 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Genetic mutation has served as the biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, intra-tumor heterogeneity may interfere with personalized treatment strategies based on mutation analysis. This study aimed to characterize somatic mutation profiling of GBM. We collected 33 samples from 7 patients with the primary GBM associated with different Choline (Cho) to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) index (CNI) through the frameless proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) guided biopsies and investigated multiple somatic mutations profiling using the AmpliSeq cancer hotspot panel V2. We identified 53 missense or nonsense mutations in 27 genes including some novel mutations such as APC and IDH2. The mutations in EGFR, TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA genes were presented with different frequency and the majority of the mutated gene was only shared by 1-2 samples from one patient. Moreover, we found the association of CNI with histological grade, but there was no significant change of CNI in the presence of TP53, EGFR and PTEN mutations. These data suggest that gene mutations constitute a heterogeneous marker for primary GBM which may be independent of intra-tumor morphological phenotypes of GBM; therefore, gene mutation markers could not be determined from a small number of needle biopsies or only confined to the high-grade region.

Title: Primary Central Nervous System Natural Killer Cell Lymphoma in a Chinese Woman with Atypical (11)C-Choline Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry Findings.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system (CNS) natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma is rare with only 7 cases reported previously. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) are frequently used for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Choline (CHO) PET is gaining popularity for identifying CNS lesions because of its high disease to background radioactivity ratio compared with FDG. Normally, CNS lymphoma shows high choline uptake on CHO-PET and a high choline peak on MRS. We present an unusual case of primary CNS NK-cell lymphoma with high choline uptake but absence of a high choline peak on MRS. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39-year-old woman presented with subacute onset of cognitive deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a gadolinium-enhancing lesion in the left temporal lobe. MRS showed suppressed N-acetyl-aspartate and the absence of a high choline peak. CHO-PET confirmed that it was the only hypermetabolic lesion in the body with moderate uptake of choline. The differential diagnoses included encephalitis and neoplasm. She was initially treated for the former but did not respond to steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis. A surgical biopsy later confirmed NK-cell lymphoma. She was then treated as primary CNS NK-cell lymphoma with intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a unique case of primary CNS NK-cell lymphoma with atypical imaging findings characterized by moderately increased uptake of choline without a corresponding high choline peak on MRS. Although CHO-PET was suggestive of malignancy, surgical biopsy was required to confirm the diagnosis.

Title: Advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography Imaging for Grading and Molecular Characterization of Glioma.
Abstract: In recent years, the management of glioma has evolved significantly, reflecting our better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tumor development, tumor progression, and treatment response. Glioma grade, along with a number of underlying molecular and genetic biomarkers, has been recognized as an important prognostic and predictive factor that can help guide the management of patients. This article highlights advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and perfusion MRI, as well as position emission tomography using various tracers including methyl-(11)C-l-methionine and O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine. Use of multiparametric imaging data has improved the diagnostic strength of imaging, introduced the potential to noninvasively interrogate underlying molecular features of low-grade glioma and to guide local therapies such as surgery and radiotherapy.

Title: IDH1 Mutation Induces Reprogramming of Pyruvate Metabolism.
Abstract: Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) catalyzes the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate but also elicits additional metabolic changes. Levels of both glutamate and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity have been shown to be affected in U87 glioblastoma cells or normal human astrocyte (NHA) cells expressing mutant IDH1, as compared with cells expressing wild-type IDH1. In this study, we show how these phenomena are linked through the effects of IDH1 mutation, which also reprograms pyruvate metabolism. Reduced PDH activity in U87 glioblastoma and NHA IDH1 mutant cells was associated with relative increases in PDH inhibitory phosphorylation, expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3, and levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha. PDH activity was monitored in these cells by hyperpolarized (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C-MRS), which revealed a reduction in metabolism of hyperpolarized 2-(13)C-pyruvate to 5-(13)C-glutamate, relative to cells expressing wild-type IDH1. (13)C-MRS also revealed a reduction in glucose flux to glutamate in IDH1 mutant cells. Notably, pharmacological activation of PDH by cell exposure to dichloroacetate (DCA) increased production of hyperpolarized 5-(13)C-glutamate in IDH1 mutant cells. Furthermore, DCA treatment also abrogated the clonogenic advantage conferred by IDH1 mutation. Using patient-derived mutant IDH1 neurosphere models, we showed that PDH activity was essential for cell proliferation. Taken together, our results established that the IDH1 mutation induces an MRS-detectable reprogramming of pyruvate metabolism, which is essential for cell proliferation and clonogenicity, with immediate therapeutic implications.

Title: SLC7A11 expression is associated with seizures and predicts poor survival in patients with malignant glioma.
Abstract: Glioma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. Its rapid growth is aided by tumor-mediated glutamate release, creating peritumoral excitotoxic cell death and vacating space for tumor expansion. Glioma glutamate release may also be responsible for seizures, which complicate the clinical course for many patients and are often the presenting symptom. A hypothesized glutamate release pathway is the cystine/glutamate transporter System xc (-) (SXC), responsible for the cellular synthesis of glutathione (GSH). However, the relationship of SXC-mediated glutamate release, seizures, and tumor growth remains unclear. Probing expression of SLC7A11/xCT, the catalytic subunit of SXC, in patient and mouse-propagated tissues, we found that ~50% of patient tumors have elevated SLC7A11 expression. Compared with tumors lacking this transporter, in vivo propagated and intracranially implanted SLC7A11-expressing tumors grew faster, produced pronounced peritumoral glutamate excitotoxicity, induced seizures, and shortened overall survival. In agreement with animal data, increased SLC7A11 expression predicted shorter patient survival according to genomic data in the REMBRANDT (National Institutes of Health Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data) database. In a clinical pilot study, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine SXC-mediated glutamate release by measuring acute changes in glutamate after administration of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved SXC inhibitor, sulfasalazine (SAS). In nine glioma patients with biopsy-confirmed SXC expression, we found that expression positively correlates with glutamate release, which is acutely inhibited with oral SAS. These data suggest that SXC is the major pathway for glutamate release from gliomas and that SLC7A11 expression predicts accelerated growth and tumor-associated seizures.

Title: Differences between glioblastomas and primary central nervous system lymphomas in 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The present study aimed to distinguish between glioblastomas and primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) using (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), especially glutamate (Glu)/creatine (Cr) and Glu/Glu+glutamine (Gln) ratios. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 46 patients (31 cases diagnosed with glioblastoma, 15 with PCNSL) were examined by in vivo single-voxel proton (1)H-MRS with a 3-T MR imaging system. Differences in absolute concentration of Cr, choline/Cr, lipid (1.3 ppm)/Cr, Glu+Gln/Cr, Glu/Cr, and Glu/Glu+Gln ratios among groups were evaluated with Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: PCNSLs [3.408 +/- 1.194 (standard deviation)] showed significantly higher Glu/Cr ratios as compared to glioblastomas (2.220 +/- 0.942; P = 0.003) [Glu/Cr cutoff ratio of 2.509 showed a sensitivity of 88 % (7/8) and a specificity of 92 % (22/24)], while glioblastomas (0.539 +/- 0.098) showed significantly lower Glu/Glu+Gln ratios as compared to PCNSLs (0.728 +/- 0.147; P < 0.001) [Glu/Glu+Gln cutoff ratio of 0.558 showed a sensitivity of 69 % (18/26) and a specificity of 100 % (13/13)]. And PCNSLs (1.101 +/- 0.387) showed significantly higher Cho/Cr ratios as compared to glioblastomas (0.850 +/- 0.465; P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Glu/Cr, Glu/Glu+Gln, and Cho/Cr ratios may be useful in distinguishing between glioblastomas and PCNSLs.

Title: Machine learning methods for the classification of gliomas: Initial results using features extracted from MR spectroscopy.
Abstract: CONTEXT: With the advent of new imaging modalities, radiologists are faced with handling increasing volumes of data for diagnosis and treatment planning. The use of automated and intelligent systems is becoming essential in such a scenario. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is increasingly being used in medical image analysis applications such as image segmentation, registration and computer-aided diagnosis and detection. Histopathological analysis is currently the gold standard for classification of brain tumors. The use of machine learning algorithms along with extraction of relevant features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds promise of replacing conventional invasive methods of tumor classification. AIMS: The aim of the study is to classify gliomas into benign and malignant types using MRI data. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective data from 28 patients who were diagnosed with glioma were used for the analysis. WHO Grade II (low-grade astrocytoma) was classified as benign while Grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma) and Grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme) were classified as malignant. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Features were extracted from MR spectroscopy. The classification was done using four machine learning algorithms: multilayer perceptrons, support vector machine, random forest and locally weighted learning. RESULTS: Three of the four machine learning algorithms gave an area under ROC curve in excess of 0.80. Random forest gave the best performance in terms of AUC (0.911) while sensitivity was best for locally weighted learning (86.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The performance of different machine learning algorithms in the classification of gliomas is promising. An even better performance may be expected by integrating features extracted from other MR sequences.

Title: OKN-007 decreases tumor necrosis and tumor cell proliferation and increases apoptosis in a preclinical F98 rat glioma model.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a malignant World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioma with a poor prognosis in humans. New therapeutics are desperately required. The nitrone OKN-007 (2,4-disulfophenyl-PBN) has demonstrated effective anti-glioma properties in several rodent models and is currently being used as a clinical investigational drug for recurrent gliomas. We assessed the regional effects of OKN-007 in the tumor necrotic core and non-necrotic tumor parenchyma. METHODS: An F98 rat glioma model was evaluated using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), morphological T2-weighted imaging (T2W) at 7 Tesla (30 cm-bore MRI), as well as immunohistochemistry and microarray assessments, at maximum tumor volumes (15-23 days following cell implantation in untreated (UT) tumors, and 18-35 days in OKN-007-treated tumors). RESULTS: (1) H-MRS data indicates that Lip0.9/Cho, Lip0.9/Cr, Lip1.3/Cho, and Lip1.3/Cr ratios are significantly decreased (all P < 0.05) in the OKN-007-treated group compared with UT F98 gliomas. The Cho/Cr ratio is also significantly decreased in the OKN-007-treated group compared with UT gliomas. In addition, the OKN-007-treated group demonstrates significantly lower ADC values in the necrotic tumor core and the nonnecrotic tumor parenchyma (both P < 0.05) compared with the UT group. There was also an increase in apoptosis following OKN-007 treatment (P < 0.01) compared with UT. CONCLUSION: OKN-007 reduces both necrosis and tumor cell proliferation, as well as seems to mediate multiple effects in different tumor regions (tumor necrotic core and nonnecrotic tumor parenchyma) in F98 gliomas, indicating the efficacy of OKN-007 as an anti-cancer agent and its potential clinical use.

Title: Image guided drug release from pH-sensitive Ion channel-functionalized stealth liposomes into an in vivo glioblastoma model.
Abstract: Liposomal drug delivery vehicles are promising nanomedicine tools for bringing cytotoxic drugs to cancerous tissues selectively. However, the triggered cargo release from liposomes in response to a target-specific stimulus has remained elusive. We report on functionalizing stealth-liposomes with an engineered ion channel and using these liposomes in vivo for releasing an imaging agent into a cerebral glioma rodent model. If the ambient pH drops below a threshold value, the channel generates temporary pores on the liposomes, thus allowing leakage of the intraluminal medicines. By using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, we show that engineered liposomes can detect the mildly acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment with 0.2 pH unit precision and they release their content into C6 glioma tumors selectively, in vivo. A drug delivery system with this level of sensitivity and selectivity to environmental stimuli may well serve as an optimal tool for environmentally-triggered and image-guided drug release. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. With advances in science, delivery systems of anti-cancer drugs have also become sophisticated. In this article, the authors designed and characterized functionalized liposomal vehicles, which would release the drug payload in a highly sensitive manner in response to a change in pH environment in an animal glioma model. The novel data would enable better future designs of drug delivery systems.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy detection of high lipid levels in intraaxial tumors without central necrosis: a characteristic of malignant lymphoma.
Abstract: OBJECT: The differentiation of malignant lymphomas from gliomas or malignant gliomas by conventional MRI can be difficult. The authors studied Gd-enhanced MR images to obtain a differential diagnosis between malignant lymphomas and gliomas without central necrosis or cystic changes and investigated the diagnostic value of single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) using different parameters, including lipid levels. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with primary malignant CNS lymphoma (n = 17) and glioma (n = 122 [Grades I, II, III, and IV in 10, 30, 33, and 49 patients, respectively]) who were treated between 2007 and 2013. The authors focused on 15 patients with homogeneously enhanced primary malignant CNS lymphomas and 7 homogeneously enhanced gliomas. Images of all the included tumors were acquired with (1)H-MRS at 3 T, and the diagnoses were histologically confirmed. RESULTS: Using a short echo time (1)H-MRS, large lipid peaks were observed in all 17 patients with a malignant lymphoma, in 39 patients (79.6%) with a Grade IV glioma, and in 10 patients (30.3%) with a Grade III glioma. A focus on homogeneously enhanced tumors revealed large lipid peaks in 15 malignant lymphomas that were free of central necrosis on Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images. Conversely, in the 7 homogeneously enhanced gliomas (glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, n = 2 each; anaplastic oligodendroglioma, diffuse astrocytoma, and pilomyxoid astrocytoma, n = 1 each), lipid peaks were small or absent. CONCLUSIONS: Large lipid peaks on (1)H-MRS images of tumors without central necrosis were characteristic of malignant lymphomas. Conversely, small or absent lipid peaks in intraaxial tumors without central necrosis were strongly suggestive of glioma.

Title: Molecular features assisting in diagnosis, surgery, and treatment decision making in low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The preferred management of suspected low-grade gliomas (LGGs) has been disputed, and the implications of molecular changes for medical and surgical management of LGGs are important to consider. Current strategies that make use of molecular markers and imaging techniques and therapeutic considerations offer additional options for management of LGGs. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes suggest a role for this abnormal metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis and progression of these primary brain tumors. Use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy can provide preoperative detection of IDH-mutated gliomas and affect surgical planning. In addition, IDH1 and IDH2 mutation status may have an effect on surgical resectability of gliomas. The IDH-mutated tumors exhibit better prognosis throughout every grade of glioma, and mutation may be an early genetic event, preceding lineage-specific secondary and tertiary alterations that transform LGGs into secondary glioblastomas. The O6-methylguanine-DNAmethyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and 1p19q codeletion status can predict sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation in low- and intermediate-grade gliomas. Thus, these recent advances, which have led to a better understanding of how molecular, genetic, and epigenetic alterations influence the pathogenicity of the different histological grades of gliomas, can lead to better prognostication and may lead to specific targeted surgical interventions and medical therapies.

Title: Metabolic reprogramming in mutant IDH1 glioma cells.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 have been reported in over 70% of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. IDH1 is the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate while mutant IDH1 catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate into 2-hydroxyglutarate. These mutations are associated with the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate within the tumor and are believed to be one of the earliest events in the development of low-grade gliomas. The goal of this work was to determine whether the IDH1 mutation leads to additional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable changes in the cellular metabolome. METHODS: Two genetically engineered cell models were investigated, a U87-based model and an E6/E7/hTERT immortalized normal human astrocyte (NHA)-based model. For both models, wild-type IDH1 cells were generated by transduction with a lentiviral vector coding for the wild-type IDH1 gene while mutant IDH1 cells were generated by transduction with a lentiviral vector coding for the R132H IDH1 mutant gene. Metabolites were extracted from the cells using the dual-phase extraction method and analyzed by 1H-MRS. Principal Component Analysis was used to analyze the MRS data. RESULTS: Principal Component Analysis clearly discriminated between wild-type and mutant IDH1 cells. Analysis of the loading plots revealed significant metabolic changes associated with the IDH1 mutation. Specifically, a significant drop in the concentration of glutamate, lactate and phosphocholine as well as the expected elevation in 2-hydroxyglutarate were observed in mutant IDH1 cells when compared to their wild-type counterparts. CONCLUSION: The IDH1 mutation leads to several, potentially translatable MRS-detectable metabolic changes beyond the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate.

Title: Citrate concentrations increase with hypoperfusion in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
Abstract: Citrate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, is present in high concentrations in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). Since citrate increases during hypoxia in animal studies, we hypothesized that it accumulates in DIPG when hypoperfused. Relative tumor blood volumes (rTBV) were determined, using dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, in twelve children [median age 8.2 (range 3.2-14.5) years] with DIPG and compared to citrate concentrations measured with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). Tissue perfusion and metabolite concentration were assessed at initial presentation and over the clinical course, yielding 36 and 46 perfusion and MR spectroscopy datasets, respectively. At presentation, DIPG blood volume was 60 +/- 27 % of that measured for normal cerebellum. Citrate, which is not detectable in normal brain tissue, was present in DIPG at concentrations of 3.81 +/- 1.44 mmol/kg tissue. Over the course of the disease and treatment, rTBV increased and citrate decreased (both p < 0.05) with an inverse correlation (p = 0.028). Citrate accumulation is associated with tissue hypoperfusion in DIPG.

Title: Influence of echo time in quantitative proton MR spectroscopy using LCModel.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to elucidate the influence on quantitative analysis using LCModel with the condition of echo time (TE) longer than the recommended values in the spectrum acquisition specifications. METHODS: A 3T magnetic resonance system was used to perform proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The participants were 5 healthy volunteers and 11 patients with glioma. Data were collected at TE of 72, 144 and 288ms. LCModel was used to quantify several metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, and choline-containing compounds). The results were compared with quantitative values obtained by using the T2-corrected internal reference method. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, when TE was long, the quantitative values obtained using LCModel were up to 6.8-fold larger (p<0.05) than those obtained using the T2-corrected internal reference method. The ratios of the quantitative values obtained by the two methods differed between metabolites (p<0.05). In patients with glioma, the ratios of quantitative values obtained by the two methods tended to be larger at longer TE, similarly to the case of healthy volunteers, and large between-individual variation in the ratios was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, TE is sometimes set longer than the value recommended for LCModel. If TE is long, LCModel overestimates the quantitative value since it cannot compensate for signal attenuation, and this effect is different for each metabolite and condition. Therefore, if TE is longer than recommended, it is necessary to account for the possibly reduced reliability of quantitative values calculated using LCModel.

Title: Cycloartan-24-ene-1alpha,2alpha,3beta-triol, a cycloartane-type triterpenoid from the resinous exudates of Commiphora myrrha, induces apoptosis in human prostatic cancer PC-3 cells.
Abstract: Plant-derived antitumor drugs are currently used in chemotherapy. Cycloartane triterpenoids have shown a cytotoxic effect on human prostate cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to isolate a cycloartane triterpenoid from Commiphora myrrha and evaluate its anticancer potential. Cycloartan-24-ene-1alpha,2alpha,3beta-triol (MY-1) was isolated from Commiphora myrrha, and its structure was determined through 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of MY-1 on human prostatic cancer PC-3 cells were estimated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining assay, and the expression of apoptotic-related proteins were evaluated by western blotting. MY-1 showed cytotoxic activity on PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 9.6 microM at 24 h. MY-1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that MY-1 regulated the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), p53 and caspase-3 in the PC-3 cells. These findings indicate that MY-1 exerts significantly pro-apoptotic activity against human hormone-independent prostatic cancer and support MY-1 as a potential anticancer drug.

Title: [Comparison of tumefactive demyelinating lesions and glioma by clinical presentations and neuroimaging studies].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and imaging features of tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDL) and glioma. METHODS: The brain computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) features of 60 pathologically confirmed TDL patients and 65 glioma ones, hospitalized at Navy General Hospital from 2005 to 2013, were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean onset age of glioma was significantly older than that of TDL. The onset symptom was headache for TDL and headache and epilepsy for glioma. The features of lesions on brain CT scan: no hyperdensity in TDL group and 39 with hyperdense lesions in glioma group. Tissue necrosis was more frequently found in lesions of glioma than TDL, especially for higher grade glioma. And increased beta and gamma-Glx on (1)H-MRS was most frequently found in TDL. CONCLUSION: The onset age of glioma is older than TDL. The headache is the top onset symptoms of TDL and epiplesy occurs frequently only in glioma. The hyperdense lesions on CT scan support more the diagnosis of glioma. The lesions with tissue necrosis may be a diagnostic clue for high grade glioma. On (1)H-MRS, increased beta and gamma-Glx are most frequently found in TDL. Dynamic observation of imaging changes may be more important for facilitating the diagnosis of TDL, especially in conjunctions with imaging characteristics and clinical features.

Title: The clinical utility of multimodal MR image-guided needle biopsy in cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic value of multimodal Magnetic Resonance (MR) Image in the stereotactic biopsy of cerebral gliomas, and investigate its implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with cerebral gliomas underwent (1)H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)- and intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI)-supported stereotactic biopsy, and 23 patients underwent only the preoperative MRI-guided biopsy. The diagnostic yield, morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed. In addition, 20 patients underwent subsequent tumor resection, thus the diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy was further evaluated. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracies of biopsies evaluated by tumor resection in the trial groups were better than control groups (92.3% and 42.9%, respectively, p = 0.031). The diagnostic yield in the trial groups was better than the control groups, but the difference was not statistically significant (100% and 82.6%, respectively, p = 0.05). The morbidity and mortality rates were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal MR image-guided glioma biopsy is practical and valuable. This technique can increase the diagnostic accuracy in the stereotactic biopsy of cerebral gliomas. Besides, it is likely to increase the diagnostic yield but requires further validation.

Title: Role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the differentiation of recurrent glioma from radiation necrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Differentiating glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis remains a great challenge. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in differentiating glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis. METHODS: Studies about evaluation of MRS for the differential diagnosis of glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis were systematically searched in PubMed, Embase and Chinese Biomedical databases up to May 4, 2014. The data were extracted to perform heterogeneity test, threshold effect test and to calculate sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and areas under summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC). RESULTS: Eighteen articles comprising a total sample size of 455 patients (447 lesions) with suspected glioma recurrence after radiotherapy, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and were included in our meta-analysis. Quantitative synthesis of studies showed that the pooled SEN and SPE for Cho/Cr ratio were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.89) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90). The area under the curve (AUC) under the SROC was 0.9001. The pooled SEN and SPE for Cho/NAA ratio were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.93) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93). The AUC under the SROC was 0.9185. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that MRS alone has moderate diagnostic performance in differentiating glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis using metabolite ratios like Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratio. It is strongly recommended that MRS should combine other advanced imaging technologies to improve diagnostic accuracy. This article underlines the importance of implementing multimodal imaging trials and multicentre trials in the future.

Title: Multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of inflammatory and neoplastic lesions of the canine brain at 3.0 T.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe findings of 3.0-T multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in dogs with inflammatory and neoplastic intracranial disease and to determine the applicability of (1)H-MRS for differentiating between inflammatory and neoplastic lesions and between meningiomas and gliomas. ANIMALS: 33 dogs with intracranial disease (19 neoplastic [10 meningioma, 7 glioma, and 2 other] and 14 inflammatory). PROCEDURES: 3.0-T multivoxel (1)H-MRS was performed on neoplastic or inflammatory intracranial lesions identified with conventional MRI. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine concentrations were obtained retrospectively, and metabolite ratios were calculated. Values were compared for metabolites separately, between lesion categories (neoplastic or inflammatory), and between neoplastic lesion types (meningioma or glioma) by means of discriminant analysis and 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The NAA-to-choline ratio was 82.7% (62/75) accurate for differentiating neoplastic from inflammatory intracranial lesions. Adding the NAA-to-creatine ratio or choline-to-creatine ratio did not affect the accuracy of differentiation. Neoplastic lesions had lower NAA concentrations and higher choline concentrations than inflammatory lesions, resulting in a lower NAA-to-choline ratio, lower NAA-to-creatine ratio, and higher choline-to-creatine ratio for neoplasia relative to inflammation. No significant metabolite differences between meningiomas and gliomas were detected. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: (1)H-MRS was effective for differentiating inflammatory lesions from neoplastic lesions. Metabolite alterations for (1)H-MRS in neoplasia and inflammation in dogs were similar to changes described for humans. Use of (1)H-MRS provided no additional information for differentiating between meningiomas and gliomas. Proton MRS may be a beneficial adjunct to conventional MRI in patients with high clinical suspicion of inflammatory or neoplastic intracranial lesions.

Title: Bevacizumab treatment induces metabolic adaptation toward anaerobic metabolism in glioblastomas.
Abstract: Anti-angiogenic therapy in glioblastoma (GBM) has unfortunately not led to the anticipated improvement in patient prognosis. We here describe how human GBM adapts to bevacizumab treatment at the metabolic level. By performing (13)C6-glucose metabolic flux analysis, we show for the first time that the tumors undergo metabolic re-programming toward anaerobic metabolism, thereby uncoupling glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation. Following treatment, an increased influx of (13)C6-glucose was observed into the tumors, concomitant to increased lactate levels and a reduction of metabolites associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This was confirmed by increased expression of glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase in the treated tumors. Interestingly, L-glutamine levels were also reduced. These results were further confirmed by the assessment of in vivo metabolic data obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography. Moreover, bevacizumab led to a depletion in glutathione levels indicating that the treatment caused oxidative stress in the tumors. Confirming the metabolic flux results, immunohistochemical analysis showed an up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase in the bevacizumab-treated tumor core as well as in single tumor cells infiltrating the brain, which may explain the increased invasion observed after bevacizumab treatment. These observations were further validated in a panel of eight human GBM patients in which paired biopsy samples were obtained before and after bevacizumab treatment. Importantly, we show that the GBM adaptation to bevacizumab therapy is not mediated by clonal selection mechanisms, but represents an adaptive response to therapy.

Title: Glioma cells with the IDH1 mutation modulate metabolic fractional flux through pyruvate carboxylase.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Over 70% of low-grade gliomas carry a heterozygous R132H mutation in the gene coding for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). This confers the enzyme with the novel ability to convert alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate, ultimately leading to tumorigenesis. The major source of 2-hydroxyglutarate production is glutamine, which, in cancer, is also a source for tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) anaplerosis. An alternate source of anaplerosis is pyruvate flux via pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which is a common pathway in normal astrocytes. The goal of this study was to determine whether PC serves as a source of TCA anaplerosis in IDH1 mutant cells wherein glutamine is used for 2-hydroxyglutarate production. METHODS: Immortalized normal human astrocytes engineered to express heterozygous mutant IDH1 or wild-type IDH1 were investigated. Flux of pyruvate via PC and via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) was determined by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the labeling of [2-(1)(3)C]glucose-derived (1)(3)C-labeled glutamate and glutamine. Activity assays, RT-PCR and western blotting were used to probe the expression and activity of relevant enzymes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data was analyzed to assess the expression of enzymes in human glioma samples. RESULTS: Compared to wild-type cells, mutant IDH1 cells significantly increased fractional flux through PC. This was associated with a significant increase in PC activity and expression. Concurrently, PDH activity significantly decreased, likely mediated by significantly increased inhibitory PDH phosphorylation by PDH kinase 3. Consistent with the observation in cells, analysis of TCGA data indicated a significant increase in PC expression in mutant IDH-expressing human glioma samples compared to wild-type IDH. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that changes in PC and PDH may be an important part of cellular adaptation to the IDH1 mutation and may serve as potential therapeutic targets.

Title: Manifold Learning in MR spectroscopy using nonlinear dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate whether nonlinear dimensionality reduction improves unsupervised classification of (1) H MRS brain tumor data compared with a linear method. METHODS: In vivo single-voxel (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (55 patients) and (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) (29 patients) data were acquired from histopathologically diagnosed gliomas. Data reduction using Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) or independent component analysis (ICA) was followed by k-means clustering or agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) for unsupervised learning to assess tumor grade and for tissue type segmentation of MRSI data. RESULTS: An accuracy of 93% in classification of glioma grade II and grade IV, with 100% accuracy in distinguishing tumor and normal spectra, was obtained by LE with unsupervised clustering, but not with the combination of k-means and ICA. With (1) H MRSI data, LE provided a more linear distribution of data for cluster analysis and better cluster stability than ICA. LE combined with k-means or AHC provided 91% accuracy for classifying tumor grade and 100% accuracy for identifying normal tissue voxels. Color-coded visualization of normal brain, tumor core, and infiltration regions was achieved with LE combined with AHC. CONCLUSION: The LE method is promising for unsupervised clustering to separate brain and tumor tissue with automated color-coding for visualization of (1) H MRSI data after cluster analysis.

Title: (11)C-methinine uptake correlates with MGMT promoter methylation in nonenhancing gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Several studies have aimed to detect biomarkers in glioma using noninvasive imaging techniques. However, few studies have been able to image 1p/19q deletion by (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography ((11)C-methionine PET) or 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This study examines the correlation between (11)C-methionine uptake and MGMT promoter methylation in grade II and grade III nonenhancing gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 20 patients with grade II and III nonenhancing gliomas who underwent both MRI and (11)C-methionine PET as part of their pre-surgical examination. We examined MGMT promoter methylation by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. RESULTS: The mean MGMT promoter methylation for tumors with T/N ratios >/=1.6 was 28.0+/-26.3, and that for tumors with T/N ratios <1.6 was 0.68+/-0.89. The MGMT promoter methylation for tumors with T/N ratios >/=1.6 was significantly higher than that for tumors with T/N ratios <1.6 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A higher uptake in (11)C-methionine PET may reflect increased MGMT promoter methylation. (11)C-methionine PET could be a useful tool to detect MGMT promoter methylation in nonenhancing glioma.

Title: Tumor-to-tumor metastasis: breast carcinoma to meningioma.
Abstract: Metastasis of breast carcinoma to meningioma is a rare phenomenon with relatively few reports in the literature, although it is the most common type of carcinoma-to-meningioma metastasis. Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these lesions, including the microenvironment and vascular network of the meningioma, expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules, local immunosuppression, and hormonal factors, including estrogen and progesterone, whose receptors have been well-characterized in these two tumor types. While histopathologic study is the cornerstone of diagnosis of these lesions, newer radiological modalities such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion MRI have shown promise, particularly in screening patients at risk for developing these lesions. Because their detection is problematic, it is imperative that clinicians thoroughly examine tissue samples of resected meningiomas, as this may alter the patient's treatment plan and prognosis. Furthermore, as both of these neoplasms often co-occur in women with breast cancer, clinicians should be vigilant of the potential for intrameningioma metastasis when neurological involvement becomes apparent in late-stage disease. While these unusual lesions should be managed surgically, as with meningiomas, it is unclear whether proposed adjuvants such as hormonal and radiation therapy improve survival.

Title: Longitudinal evaluation of the metabolic response of a tumor xenograft model to single fraction radiation therapy using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to evaluate the metabolic profile of human glioblastoma multiform brain tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice before, and at multiple time points after single fraction radiation therapy. Tumors were grown over the thigh in 16 mice in this study, of which 5 served as untreated controls and 11 had their tumors treated to 800 cGy with 200 kVp x-rays. Spectra were acquired within 24 h pre-treatment, and then at 3, 7 and 14 d post-treatment using a 9.4 T animal magnetic resonance (MR) system. For the untreated control tumors, spectra (1-2 per mouse) were acquired at different stages of tumor growth. Spectra were obtained with the PRESS pulse sequence using a 3  x  3 x 3 mm(3) voxel. Analysis was performed with the LCModel software platform. Six metabolites were profiled for this analysis: alanine (Ala), myo-inositol (Ins), taurine (Tau), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr + PCr), glutamine and glutamate (Glu + Gln), and total choline (glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine) (GPC + PCh). For the treated cohort, most metabolite/water concentration ratios were found to decrease in the short term at 3 and 7 d post-treatment, followed by an increase at 14 d post-treatment toward pre-treatment values. The lowest concentrations were observed at 7 d post-treatment, with magnitudes (relative to pre-treatment concentration ratios) of: 0.42  +/-  24.6% (Ala), 0.43  +/-  15.3% (Ins), 0.68  +/-  27.9% (Tau), 0.52  +/-  14.6% (GPC+PCh), 0.49  +/-  21.0% (Cr + PCr) and 0.78  +/-  24.5% (Glu + Gln). Control animals did not demonstrate any significant correlation between tumor volume and metabolite concentration, indicating that the observed kinetics were the result of the therapeutic intervention. We have demonstrated the feasibility of using MRS to follow multiple metabolic markers over time for the purpose of evaluating therapeutic response of tumors to radiation therapy. This study provides supporting evidence that metabolite/water concentration ratios have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the assessment of the response to therapy.

Title: Anaplastic transformation of low-grade gliomas (WHO II) on magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Malignant transformation among gliomas WHO II ranges between 35% and 89%. However, according to some reports, all gliomas WHO II undergo such transformation over time. The aim of the study was to analyse MRI parameters indicating anaplastic transformation of gliomas WHO II. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients were enrolled in the study (20 females and 26 males; range of age 36 +/- 9 years) with supratentorial glioma WHO II. Multiparametric MR examination included morphological imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Group division depended on the course of disease (ST - stable group, AT - anaplastic transformation group). RESULTS: Subtotal tumour resection was achieved in the whole AT group, whereas in the ST group, total tumour resection was achieved in 10/29 (34%) patients. The size of the residual tumour after surgery was statistically significantly higher in the AT group compared to the ST group (AT: 51.5 cm(3) +/- 37.7 vs. ST: 29.0 cm(3) +/- 37.9; p = 0.011). Contrast enhancement in the AT group occurred in 5/11 (45%) of tumours and in none of the patients' areas of contrast enhancement were resected during surgery/biopsy. However, the initial MR showed contrast enhancement in 10/29 (34%) of patients in the ST group. The areas of contrast enhancement were totally resected in all patients. Compared to the ST group tumours that underwent anaplastic transformation had statistically significantly higher values of mean nrCBV and max nrCBV on the initial MR, the follow-up and final MR examinations. However, statistically significant differences between the groups in ADC values were observed on the follow-up and final MR whereas mean Cho/Cr and mean Cho/NAA were observed as late as on the final MR examination. CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric MR examination allows the detection of LGGs with high probability of rapid anaplastic transformation and the detection of transformation prior to the occurrence of contrast enhancement. The value of nrCBV is the most useful in the diagnosis of anaplastic transformation. The resection of contrast enhancement area of the tumour significantly increases time to anaplastic transformation of LGGs.

Title: Lactate and choline metabolites detected in vitro by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are potential metabolic biomarkers for PI3K inhibition in pediatric glioblastoma.
Abstract: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is believed to be of key importance in pediatric glioblastoma. Novel inhibitors of the PI3K pathway are being developed and are entering clinical trials. Our aim is to identify potential non-invasive biomarkers of PI3K signaling pathway inhibition in pediatric glioblastoma using in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, to aid identification of target inhibition and therapeutic response in early phase clinical trials of PI3K inhibitors in childhood cancer. Treatment of SF188 and KNS42 human pediatric glioblastoma cell lines with the dual pan-Class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103, inhibited the PI3K signaling pathway and resulted in a decrease in phosphocholine (PC), total choline (tCho) and lactate levels (p<0.02) as detected by phosphorus (31P)- and proton (1H)-NMR. Similar changes were also detected using the pan-Class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 which lacks significant mTOR activity and is entering Phase II clinical trials. In contrast, the DNA damaging agent temozolomide (TMZ), which is used as current frontline therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma postoperatively (in combination with radiotherapy), increased PC, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and tCho levels (p<0.04). PI-103-induced NMR changes were associated with alterations in protein expression levels of regulatory enzymes involved in glucose and choline metabolism including GLUT1, HK2, LDHA and CHKA. Our results show that by using NMR we can detect distinct biomarkers following PI3K pathway inhibition compared to treatment with the DNA-damaging anti-cancer agent TMZ. This is the first study reporting that lactate and choline metabolites are potential non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring response to PI3K pathway inhibitors in pediatric glioblastoma.

Title: (1) H 2D MRSI tissue type analysis of gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To decompose 1H MR spectra of glioma patients into normal and abnormal tissue proportions for tumor classification and delineation. METHODS: Anatomical imaging and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data have been acquired from 11 grade II and 13 grade IV glioma patients. LCModel was used to decompose the magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data into normal brain, grade II, and grade IV tissue proportions using a tissue type basis set. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the methodology. Results were visualized using colormaps and abnormality contours showing tumor grade and extent. RESULTS: Simulations suggest that infiltrative tumor proportions as low as 20% can be identified at the typical 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy signal-to-noise found in vivo. Tumor grading according to the highest estimated tumor grade within a lesion gave a classification accuracy of 86% discriminating between grade II and grade IV glioma. Voxels with significant proportions of tumor type spectra were found beyond the margins of contrast enhancement for most grade IV cases consistent with infiltration whereas the abnormality contours show that some tumors are confined within the hyperintensities shown by both post contrast T1 weighted and T2 weighted imaging. CONCLUSION: LCModel can be used to decompose 1H MR spectra into proportions of normal and abnormal tissue to identify tumor extent, infiltration, and overall grade.

Title: Thermoreversible poly(ethylene glycol)-g-chitosan hydrogel as a therapeutic T lymphocyte depot for localized glioblastoma immunotherapy.
Abstract: The outcome for glioblastoma patients remains dismal for its invariably recrudesces within 2 cm of the resection cavity. Local immunotherapy has the potential to eradicate the residual infiltrative component of these tumors. Here, we report the development of a biodegradable hydrogel containing therapeutic T lymphocytes for localized delivery to glioblastoma cells for brain tumor immunotherapy. Thermoreversible poly(ethylene glycol)-g-chitosan hydrogels (PCgels) were optimized for steady T lymphocyte release. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the chemical structure of poly(ethylene glycol)-g-chitosan, and rheological studies revealed that the sol-to-gel transition of the PCgel occurred around >/=32  degrees C. T lymphocyte invasion through the PCgel and subsequent cytotoxicity to glioblastoma were assessed in vitro. The PCgel was shown to be cellular compatible with T lymphocytes, and the T lymphocytes retain their anti-glioblastoma activity after being encapsulated in the PCgel. T lymphocytes in the PCgel were shown to be more effective in killing glioblastoma than those in the Matrigel control. This may be attributed to the optimal pore size of the PCgel allowing better invasion of T lymphocytes. Our study suggests that this unique PCgel depot may offer a viable approach for localized immunotherapy for glioblastoma.

Title: Hyperpolarized [1-13C] glutamate: a metabolic imaging biomarker of IDH1 mutational status in glioma.
Abstract: Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene are among the most prevalent in low-grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma, represent an early pathogenic event, and are associated with epigenetically driven modulations of metabolism. Of particular interest is the recently uncovered relationship between the IDH1 mutation and decreased activity of the branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) enzyme. Noninvasive imaging methods that can assess BCAT1 activity could therefore improve detection of mutant IDH1 tumors and aid in developing and monitoring new targeted therapies. BCAT1 catalyzes the transamination of branched-chain amino acids while converting alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to glutamate. Our goal was to use (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the conversion of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] alpha-KG to hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] glutamate as a readout of BCAT1 activity. We investigated two isogenic glioblastoma lines that differed only in their IDH1 status and performed experiments in live cells and in vivo in rat orthotopic tumors. Following injection of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] alpha-KG, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] glutamate production was detected both in cells and in vivo, and the level of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] glutamate was significantly lower in mutant IDH1 cells and tumors compared with their IDH1-wild-type counterparts. Importantly however, in our cells the observed drop in hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] glutamate was likely mediated not only by a drop in BCAT1 activity, but also by reductions in aspartate transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities, suggesting additional metabolic reprogramming at least in our model. Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] glutamate could thus inform on multiple mutant IDH1-associated metabolic events that mediate reduced glutamate production.

Title: The potential role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in image-guided radiotherapy.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique to detect metabolites within the normal and tumoral tissues. The ability of MRS to diagnose areas of high metabolic activity linked to tumor cell proliferation is particularly useful for radiotherapy treatment planning because of better gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation. The GTV may be targeted with higher radiation dose, potentially improving local control without excessive irradiation to the normal adjacent tissues. Prostate cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are two tumor models that are associated with a heterogeneous tumor distribution. Preliminary studies suggest that the integration of MRS into radiotherapy planning for these tumors is feasible and safe. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) by virtue of daily tumor imaging and steep dose gradient may allow for tumor dose escalation with the simultaneous integrated boost technique (SIB) and potentially decrease the complications rates in patients with GBM and prostate cancers.

Title: Observation of true and pseudo NOE signals using CEST-MRI and CEST-MRS sequences with and without lipid suppression.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics of nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) imaging signals in the brain at 7T. METHODS: Fresh hen eggs, as well as six healthy, and six C6 glioma-bearing Wistar rats were scanned using chemical exchange saturation transfer-magnetic resonance imaging (CEST-MRI) and chemical exchange saturation transfer-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CEST-MRS) sequences (saturation duration 3 s, power 1.47 microT) with and without lipid suppression. CEST data were acquired over an offset range of -6 to +6 ppm relative to the water resonance in 0.5 ppm steps. RESULTS: The water signals were not disrupted by other protons during the CEST-MRS sequences, and true NOE signals could be observed. Using the CEST-MRI sequence without lipid suppression, pseudo NOE imaging signals were observed in the lipid-containing regions (egg yolk, scalp, and even white matter). These pseudo NOE signals were almost (but incompletely) removed with the lipid suppression. Egg yolk results indicated the presence of the NOE to olefinic protons overlapping with the water signal. In vivo experiments showed that the amide proton transfer signal was larger in the tumor, whereas the NOE signal was larger in the normal white matter. CONCLUSIONS: True NOE signals can be detected using MRS sequences, and considerable pseudo NOE imaging signals may be observed using MRI sequences.

Title: Comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography in detection of tumor recurrence in posttreatment of glioma: A diagnostic meta-analysis.
Abstract: It is important to distinguish between tumor recurrence and treatment effects in posttreatment patients with high-grade gliomas. Several imaging modalities have been reported in differentiating between tumor recurrence and treatment effects. However, there were no consistent conclusions between different studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 23 studies that compared the diagnostic values of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET (positron emission tomography) or PET/CT (computed tomography) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in predicting tumor recurrence of gliomas. The pooled estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and summary receiver operating characteristic curves of (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET or PET/CT and MRS in detecting tumor recurrence were calculated. In conclusion, MRS is highly sensitive in the detection of tumor recurrence in glioma.(18)F-FDG PET or PET/CT is highly specific in recurrence diagnosis. (11)C-MET does not have noticeable advantage over (18)F-FDG. The current evidence shows no statistical difference between MRS and PET on the accuracy.

Title: Comparison of three reference methods for the measurement of intracellular pH using 31P MRS in healthy volunteers and patients with lymphoma.
Abstract: 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) can measure intracellular pH (pHi) using the chemical shift difference between pH-dependent inorganic phosphate (Pi) and a pH-independent reference peak. This study compared three different frequency reference peaks [phosphocreatine (PCr), alpha resonance of adenosine triphosphate (alphaATP) and water (using 1H MRS)] in a cohort of 10 volunteers and eight patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Well-resolved chemical shift imaging (CSI) spectra were acquired on a 1.5T scanner for muscle, liver and tumour. The pH was calculated for all volunteers and patients using the available methods. The consistency of the resulting pH was evaluated. The direct Pi-PCr method was best for those spectra with a very well-defined PCr, such as muscle (pH=7.05 +/- 0.02). In liver, the Pi-alphaATP method gave more consistent results (pH=7.30 +/- 0.06) than the calibrated water-based method (pH=7.27 +/- 0.11). In NHL nodes, the measured pH using the Pi-alphaATP method was 7.25 +/- 0.12. Given that the measured range includes some biological variation in individual patients, treatment-related changes of the order of 0.1 pH units should be detectable.

Abstract: QUESTION: Which imaging techniques most accurately differentiate true tumor progression from pseudo-progression or treatment related changes in patients with previously diagnosed glioblastoma? TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with previously diagnosed glioblastoma who are suspected of experiencing progression of the neoplastic process. RECOMMENDATIONS LEVEL II: Magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement is recommended as the imaging surveillance method to detect the progression of previously diagnosed glioblastoma. LEVEL II: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is recommended as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. LEVEL III: The routine use of positron emission tomography to identify progression of glioblastoma is not recommended. LEVEL III: Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging is recommended as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma.

Title: Accuracy of 2-hydroxyglutarate quantification by short-echo proton-MRS at 3 T: a phantom study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We set out to investigate the potential confounding effect of variable concentration of N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA) and Glutamate (Glu) on measurement of the brain oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) using a standard MRS protocol. This issue may arise due to spectral overlap at clinical magnetic field strengths and thus complicate the usage of 2HG as a putative biomarker of gliomas bearing mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes. METHODS: Spectra from 25 phantoms (50 mL falcon test tubes) containing a range of known concentrations of 2HG, NAA and Glu were acquired using a clinical 3 T scanner with a quadrature head coil, single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence with TE = 30 ms. Metabolite concentrations were estimated by linear combination analysis and a simulated basis set. RESULTS: NAA and Glu concentrations can have a significant confounding effect on 2HG measurements, whereby the negative changes in concentration of these metabolites typically observed in (peri)lesional areas can lead to under-estimation of 2HG concentration with respect to spectra acquired in presence of physiological levels of NAA and Glu. CONCLUSION: The confounding effect of NAA and Glu concentration changes needs to be considered: in patients, it may mask the presence of 2HG at low concentrations, however it is not expected to lead to false positives. 2HG data acquired using standard short echo-time MRS protocols should be considered with caution.

Title: Glutamate quantification in patients with supratentorial gliomas using chemical shift imaging.
Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate and validate chemical shift imaging (CSI) for in vivo glutamate (Glu) quantification in patients with supratentorial gliomas. If validated, CSI could become an extremely useful tool to investigate metabolic dysfunction of Glu in excitotoxic neuropathologies. Quantitative CSI estimates of Glu concentrations were compared with known concentrations of Glu in aqueous phantom solutions. Forty-one patients with known or likely supratentorial gliomas underwent preoperative CSI. The spectra obtained were analyzed for Glu concentrations and Glu to creatine (Cr) ratios. These in vivo measurements were correlated against ex vivo Glu content quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measured in 65 resected brain tumor and peritumoral brain specimens. For the phantom solutions the CSI estimates of Glu concentration and the Glu/Cr ratios were highly correlated with known Glu concentration (r(2)  = 0.95, p = 0.002, and r(2)  = 0.97, p < 0.0001, respectively). There was a modest, but statistically significant, correlation between the ex vivo measured Glu and in vivo spectroscopic Glu concentration (r(2)  = 0.22, p = 0.04) and ratios of Glu to Cr (r(2)  = 0.30, p = 0.002). Quantitative measurement of Glu content is feasible in patients with supratentorial gliomas using CSI. The in vitro and in vivo results suggest that this has the potential to be a reliable quantitative imaging assay for brain tumor patients. This may have wide clinical research applications in a number of neurological disorders where Glu excitotoxicity and metabolic dysfunction are known to play a role in pathogenesis, including tumor associated epilepsy, epilepsy, stroke and neurotrauma.

Title: In vivo brain macromolecule signals in healthy and glioblastoma mouse models: 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, post-processing and metabolite quantification at 14.1 T.
Abstract: In (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, macromolecule signals underlay metabolite signals, and knowing their contribution is necessary for reliable metabolite quantification. When macromolecule signals are measured using an inversion-recovery pulse sequence, special care needs to be taken to correctly remove residual metabolite signals to obtain a pure macromolecule spectrum. Furthermore, since a single spectrum is commonly used for quantification in multiple experiments, the impact of potential macromolecule signal variability, because of regional differences or pathologies, on metabolite quantification has to be assessed. In this study, we introduced a novel method to post-process measured macromolecule signals that offers a flexible and robust way of removing residual metabolite signals. This method was applied to investigate regional differences in the mouse brain macromolecule signals that may affect metabolite quantification when not taken into account. However, since no significant differences in metabolite quantification were detected, it was concluded that a single macromolecule spectrum can be generally used for the quantification of healthy mouse brain spectra. Alternatively, the study of a mouse model of human glioma showed several alterations of the macromolecule spectrum, including, but not limited to, increased mobile lipid signals, which had to be taken into account to avoid significant metabolite quantification errors.

Title: Multidimensional texture characterization: on analysis for brain tumor tissues using MRS and MRI.
Abstract: This paper investigates the efficacy of automated pattern recognition methods on magnetic resonance data with the objective of assisting radiologists in the clinical diagnosis of brain tissue tumors. In this paper, the sciences of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are combined to improve the accuracy of the classifier, based on the multidimensional co-occurrence matrices to assess the detection of pathological tissues (tumor and edema), normal tissues (white matter - WM and gray matter - GM), and fluid (cerebrospinal fluid - CSF). The results show the ability of the classifier with iterative training to automatically and simultaneously recover tissue-specific spectral and structural patterns and achieve segmentation of tumor and edema and grading of high and low glioma tumor. Here, extreme learning machine - improved particle swarm optimization (ELM-IPSO) neural network classifier is trained with the feature descriptions in brain magnetic resonance (MR) spectra. This has the characteristics of varying the normal spectral pattern associated with tumor patterns along with imaging features. Validation was performed considering 35 clinical studies. The volumetric features extracted from the vectors of this matrix articulate some important elementary structures, which along with spectroscopic metabolite ratios discriminate the tumor grades and tissue classes. The quantitative 3D analysis reveals significant improvement in terms of global accuracy rate for automatic classification in brain tissues and discriminating pathological tumor tissue from structural healthy brain tissue.

Title: Giant cerebral cysticercosis in an infant confused with a thalamic glioma.
Abstract: Neurocysticercosis is a common parasitic infection of the central nervous system. Intraparenchymal giant cysticercosis has been described in literature, but this is a rare report of a thalamic giant cysticercosis in a young child where the diagnosis could be made on follow-up. A 1(1/2)-year-old male child presented with seizures, hemiparesis, and features of raised intracranial pressure. Initial neuroimaging findings of thalamic swelling with minimal edema and contrast enhancement with choline peak on magnetic resonance spectroscopy were attributed to thalamic glioma. Subsequent imaging revealed a ring enhancing lesion with an eccentric nodule suggestive of neurocysticercosis. It later resolved with residual gliosis. The presence of a pathognomic scolex and the resolution of size and symptoms without definitive treatment helped in making the diagnosis. This report reinforces the importance of considering cysticercosis in diagnosis of acute presentations of large cerebral masses in infants, particularly in prevalent regions, and emphasizes the follow-up of these patients.

Title: Radiotherapy of high-grade gliomas: current standards and new concepts, innovations in imaging and radiotherapy, and new therapeutic approaches.
Abstract: The current standards in radiotherapy of high-grade gliomas (HGG) are based on anatomic imaging techniques, usually computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The guidelines vary depending on whether the HGG is a histological grade 3 anaplastic glioma (AG) or a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For AG, T2-weighted MRI sequences plus the region of contrast enhancement in T1 are considered for the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV), and an isotropic expansion of 15 to 20 mm is recommended for the clinical target volume (CTV). For GBM, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group favors a two-step technique, with an initial phase (CTV1) including any T2 hyperintensity area (edema) plus a 20 mm margin treated with up to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a reduction in CTV2 to the contrast enhancement region in T1 with an additional 25 mm margin. The European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer recommends a single-phase technique with a unique GTV, which comprises the T1 contrast enhancement region plus a margin of 20 to 30 mm. A total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions is usually delivered for GBM, and a dose of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions is typically given for AG. As more than 85% of HGGs recur in field, dose-escalation studies have shown that 70 to 75 Gy can be delivered in 6 weeks with relevant toxicities developing in <10% of the patients. However, the only randomized dose-escalation trial, in which the boost dose was guided by conventional MRI, did not show any survival advantage of this treatment over the reference arm. HGGs are amongst the most infiltrative and heterogeneous tumors, and it was hypothesized that the most highly aggressive areas were missed; thus, better visualization of these high-risk regions for radiation boost could decrease the recurrence rate. Innovations in imaging and linear accelerators (LINAC) could help deliver the right doses of radiation to the right subvolumes according to the dose-painting concept. Advanced imaging techniques provide functional information on cellular density (diffusion MRI), angiogenesis (perfusion MRI), metabolic activity and cellular proliferation [positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)]. All of these non-invasive techniques demonstrated good association between the images and histology, with up to 40% of HGGs functionally presenting a high activity within the non-contrast-enhanced areas in T1. New LINAC technologies, such as intensity-modulated and stereotactic radiotherapy, help to deliver a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) > 60 Gy. Trials delivering a SIB into a biological GTV showed the feasibility of this treatment, but the final results, in terms of clinical benefits for HGG patients, are still pending. Many issues have been identified: the variety of MRI and PET machines (and amino-acid tracers), the heterogeneity of the protocols used for image acquisition and post-treatment, the geometric distortion and the unreliable algorithms for co-registration of brain anatomy with functional maps, and the semi-quiescent but highly invasive HGG cells. These issues could be solved by the homogenization of the protocols and software applications, the simultaneous acquisition of anatomic and functional images (PET-MRI machines), the combination of complementary imaging tools (perfusion and diffusion MRI), and the concomitant addition of some ad hoc targeted drugs against angiogenesis and invasiveness to chemoradiotherapy. The integration of these hybrid data will construct new synthetic metrics for fully individualized treatments.

Title: Molecular and metabolic pattern classification for detection of brain glioma progression.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The ability to differentiate between brain tumor progression and radiation therapy induced necrosis is critical for appropriate patient management. In order to improve the differential diagnosis, we combined fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) and histological data to develop a multi-parametric machine-learning model. METHODS: We enrolled twelve post-therapy patients with grade 2 and 3 gliomas that were suspicious of tumor progression. All patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET and (1)H MRS. Maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumors and reference regions were obtained. Multiple 2D maps of choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) of the tumors were generated. A support vector machine (SVM) learning model was established to take imaging biomarkers and histological data as input vectors. A combination of clinical follow-up and multiple sequential MRI studies served as the basis for assessing the clinical outcome. All vector combinations were evaluated for diagnostic accuracy and cross validation. The optimal cutoff value of individual parameters was calculated using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. RESULTS: The SVM and ROC analyses both demonstrated that SUVmax of the lesion was the most significant single diagnostic parameter (75% accuracy) followed by Cho concentration (67% accuracy). SVM analysis of all paired parameters showed SUVmax and Cho concentration in combination could achieve 83% accuracy. SUVmax of the lesion paired with SUVmax of the white matter as well as the tumor Cho paired with the tumor Cr both showed 83% accuracy. These were the most significant paired diagnostic parameters of either modality. Combining all four parameters did not improve the results. However, addition of two more parameters, Cho and Cr of brain parenchyma contralateral to the tumor, increased the accuracy to 92%. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that SVM models may improve detection of glioma progression more accurately than single parametric imaging methods.

Title: Magnetic resonance imaging of tumor glycolysis using hyperpolarized 13C-labeled glucose.
Abstract: In this study, we monitored glycolysis in mouse lymphoma and lung tumors by measuring the conversion of hyperpolarized [U-2H, U-13C]glucose to lactate using 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging. We observed labeled lactate only in tumors and not in surrounding normal tissue or other tissues in the body and found that it was markedly decreased at 24 h after treatment with a chemotherapeutic drug. We also detected an increase in a resonance assigned to 6-phosphogluconate in the pentose phosphate pathway. This technique could provide a new way of detecting early evidence of tumor treatment response in the clinic and of monitoring tumor pentose phosphate pathway activity.

Title: Advanced MR imaging techniques in the evaluation of nonenhancing gliomas: perfusion-weighted imaging compared with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tumor grade.
Abstract: A significant number of nonenhancing (NE) gliomas are reported to be malignant. The purpose of this study was to compare the value of advanced MR imaging techniques, including T2*-dynamic susceptibility contrast PWI (DSC-PWI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)HMRS) in the evaluation of NE gliomas. Twenty patients with NE gliomas underwent MRI including DSC-PWI and (1)HMRS. The relative CBV (rCBV) measurements were obtained from regions of maximum perfusion. The peak ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) and myo-inositol/creatine (mIns/Cr) were measured at a TE of 30 ms. Demographic features, tumor volumes, and PWI- and (1)HMRS-derived measures were compared between low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs). In addition, the association of initial rCBV ratio with tumor progression was evaluated in LGGs. No significant difference was noted in age, sex or tumor size between LGGs and HGGs. Cho/Cr ratios were significantly higher in HGGs (1.7+/-0.63) than in LGGs (1.2+/-0.38). The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that a Cho/Cr ratio with a cutoff value of 1.3 could differentiate between LGG and HGG with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 71.4%. There was no significant difference in the rCBV ratio and the mIns/Cr ratio between LGG and HGG. However, higher rCBV ratios were observed with more rapid progressions in LGGs. The results imply that Cho/Cr ratios are useful in distinguishing NE LGG from HGG and can be helpful in preoperative grading and biopsy guidance. On the other hand, rCBV ratios do not help in the distinction.

Title: Neuro-oncology: Five new things.
Abstract: Recent reports herald important advances in our understanding and management of gliomas. A role for alkylator chemotherapy in the management of certain high-grade gliomas has been confirmed and linked to specific, clinically ascertainable molecular markers. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can now image 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite restricted to the three-quarters of low-intermediate grade gliomas harboring an isocitrate dehydrogenase gene mutation; this has powerful implications for diagnosis and assessment of response to therapies. Genome-wide association studies point to several SNPs conveying increased risk of glioma; further studies of the involved genes and RNA products will enhance our understanding of glioma development. Finally, high-throughput sequencing has identified novel mutations in a histone-coding gene and in genes related to the histone complex in pediatric glioblastoma.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in intracranial tumours of glial origin.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) characteristics of intracranial glial tumours and to assess MRS reliability in glioma grading and discrimination between different histopathological types of tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of spectra of 26 patients with glioblastomas, 6 with fibrillary astrocytomas, 4 with anaplastic astrocytomas, 2 with pilocytic astrocytoma, 3 with oligodendrogliomas, 3 with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and 17 control spectra taken from healthy hemispheres. RESULTS: All tumours' metabolite ratios, except for Cho/Cr in fibrillary astrocytomas (p = 0.06), were statistically significantly different from the control. The tumours showed decreased Naa and Cr contents and a high Cho signal. The Lac-Lip signal was high in grade III astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Reports that Cho/Cr ratio increases with glioma's grade whereas Naa/Cr decreases were not confirmed. Anaplastic astrocytomas compared to grade II astrocytomas had a statistically significantly greater mI/Cr ratio (p = 0.02). In pilocytic astrocytomas the Naa/Cr value (2.58 +/- 0.39) was greater, whilst the Cho/Naa ratio was lower (2.14 +/- 0.64) than in the other astrocytomas. The specific feature of oligodendrogliomas was the presence of glutamate/glutamine peak Glx. However, this peak was absent in two out of three anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Characteristically, the latter tumours had a high Lac-Lip signal. CONCLUSIONS: MRS in vivo cannot be used as a reliable method for glioma grading. The method is useful in discrimination between WHO grade I and WHO grade II astrocytomas as well as oligodendrogliomas from other gliomas.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for Differentiating Pseudo-Progression from True Progression in GBM on Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy.
Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy including temozolomide is commonly used for the treatment of gliomas. However, increased lesion size and contrast enhancement are frequently observed following this therapy and this appearance is termed as 'pseudo-progression'. Since conventional imaging is unable to differentiate pseudo-progression from tumour recurrence, we evaluated the utility of MR spectroscopy (MRS) to differentiate these two pathological entities. Longitudinal MRI and MRS studies prior to and within four months post chemo-radiation therapy including diffusion-weighted imaging and single voxel spectroscopy (short and intermediate echo) were performed in 62 glioblastoma (GBM) patients undergoing chemo-radiation therapy. Clinical follow-up demonstrated four cases of pseudo-progression. In this study, results from these four cases and a known case of tumour recurrence are reported. Metabolite ratios and presence or absence of lipids at 1.3 ppm were used to differentiate between pseudo-progression and tumour recurrence. All four cases of pseudo-progression demonstrated elevated lipid signals on MRS. Additionally, an absence of choline or a low choline/NAA ratio was also observed. In comparison, the patient with tumour recurrence showed lower lipid signals and a high choline/NAA ratio. The presence of elevated lipid signals along with low choline/NAA ratios can aid in differentiation of pseudo-progression from tumour recurrence.

Title: Non-invasive in vivo assessment of IDH1 mutational status in glioma.
Abstract: Gain-of-function mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene are among the most prevalent in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma. They lead to intracellular accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, represent an early pathogenic event and are considered a therapeutic target. Here we show, in this proof-of-concept study, that [1-(13)C] alpha-ketoglutarate can serve as a metabolic imaging agent for non-invasive, real-time, in vivo monitoring of mutant IDH1 activity, and can inform on IDH1 status. Using (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, the metabolic fate of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] alpha-ketoglutarate is studied in isogenic glioblastoma cells that differ only in their IDH1 status. In lysates and tumours that express wild-type IDH1, only hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] alpha-ketoglutarate can be detected. In contrast, in cells that express mutant IDH1, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] 2-hydroxyglutarate is also observed, both in cell lysates and in vivo in orthotopic tumours.

Title: Disseminated encephalomyelitis-like central nervous system neoplasm in childhood.
Abstract: A malignant neoplasm in the central nervous system with diffuse white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is rare in children. It could be misdiagnosed as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. This report presents our experience based on 4 patients (3 male, 1 female; aged 7-13 years) whose MRI showed diffuse lesions in white matter and who were initially diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. All of the patients received corticosteroid therapy. After brain biopsy, the patients were diagnosed with gliomatosis cerebri, primitive neuroectodermal tumor and central nervous system lymphoma. We also provide literature reviews and discuss the differentiation of central nervous system neoplasm from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.

Title: Differential diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas based on magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) characteristics of intracranial meningiomas and to assess MRS reliability in meningioma grading and discrimination from tumours of similar radiological appearance, such as lymphomas, schwannomas and haemangiopericytomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of spectra of 14 patients with meningiomas, 6 with schwannomas, 2 with lymphomas, 2 with haemangiopericytomas and 17 control spectra taken from healthy hemispheres. RESULTS: All the patients with meningiomas had a high Cho signal (long TE). There were very low signals of Naa and Cr in the spectra of 10 patients. A reversed Ala doublet was seen only in 2 cases. Four patients had a negative Lac signal, whereas 3 had high Lac-Lip spectra. Twelve spectra showed high Cho signals (short TE). In one case the Cho signal was extremely low. All spectra displayed a very low Cr signal, but high Glx and Lac-Lip signals. Ala presence was found only in 3 patients. The mean Cho/Cr ratio (PRESS) was 5.97 (1.12 in normal brain, p < 0.05). Lac-Lip was present in all the meningiomas (STEAM). The Ala signal was seen only in 2 spectra with long TE and in 3 sequences of the short TE sequences. There were both beta/gamma-Glx and alpha-Glx/glutathione signals in all 14 meningiomas. CONCLUSIONS: MRS is unable to discriminate low and high grade meningiomas. The method seems to be helpful in discriminating lymphomas (absent Glx signal), schwannomas (mI signal in the short TE sequences) and haemangiopericytomas (presence of mI band) from meningiomas.

Title: Evaluation of LDH-A and glutaminase inhibition in vivo by hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy of tumors.
Abstract: Hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to detect real-time metabolic fluxes as a means to measure metabolic treatment responses in vivo. Here, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase-A suppressed the conversion of hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate to lactate in murine xenografts of P493 human lymphoma. In contrast, a glutaminase inhibitor reduced conversion of (13)C-pyruvate to alanine without affecting conversion of pyruvate to lactate. These results illustrate the ability to monitor biomarkers for responses to antimetabolic therapy in real-time, paving the way for clinical development of imaging biomarkers to monitor metabolic pharmacodynamics.

Title: Imaging of brain metastases.
Abstract: Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Imaging is used to detect metastases in patients with known malignancies and new neurological signs or symptoms, as well as to screen for CNS involvement in patients with known cancer. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the key imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of brain metastases. In difficult cases, such as newly diagnosed solitary enhancing brain lesions in patients without known malignancy, advanced imaging techniques including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), contrast enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may aid in arriving at the correct diagnosis. This image-rich review discusses the imaging evaluation of patients with suspected intracranial involvement and malignancy, describes typical imaging findings of parenchymal brain metastasis on CT and MRI, and provides clues to specific histological diagnoses such as the presence of hemorrhage. Additionally, the role of advanced imaging techniques is reviewed, specifically in the context of differentiating metastasis from high-grade glioma and other solitary enhancing brain lesions. Extra-axial CNS involvement by metastases, including pachymeningeal and leptomeningeal metastases is also briefly reviewed.

Title: Application of 31P MR spectroscopy to the brain tumors.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical feasibility and obtain useful parameters of (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study for making the differential diagnosis of brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with brain tumorous lesions (22 cases of brain tumor and 6 cases of abscess) and 11 normal volunteers were included. The patients were classified into the astrocytoma group, lymphoma group, metastasis group and the abscess group. We obtained the intracellular pH and the metabolite ratios of phosphomonoesters/phosophodiesters (PME/PDE), PME/inorganic phosphate (Pi), PDE/Pi, PME/adenosine triphosphate (ATP), PDE/ATP, PME/phosphocreatine (PCr), PDE/PCr, PCr/ATP, PCr/Pi, and ATP/Pi, and evaluated the statistical significances. RESULTS: The brain tumors had a tendency of alkalization (pH = 7.28 +/- 0.27, p = 0.090), especially the pH of the lymphoma was significantly increased (pH = 7.45 +/- 0.32, p = 0.013). The brain tumor group showed increased PME/PDE ratio compared with that in the normal control group (p = 0.012). The ratios of PME/PDE, PDE/Pi, PME/PCr and PDE/PCr showed statistically significant differences between each brain lesion groups (p < 0.05). The astrocytoma showed an increased PME/PDE and PME/PCr ratio. The ratios of PDE/Pi, PME/PCr, and PDE/PCr in lymphoma group were lower than those in the control group and astrocytoma group. The metastasis group showed an increased PME/PDE ratio, compared with that in the normal control group. CONCLUSION: We have obtained the clinically applicable (31)P MRS, and the pH, PME/PDE, PDE/Pi, PME/PCr, and PDE/PCr ratios are helpful for differentiating among the different types of brain tumors.

Title: In vivo intracellular oxygen dynamics in murine brain glioma and immunotherapeutic response of cytotoxic T cells observed by fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: Noninvasive biomarkers of anti-tumoral efficacy are of great importance to the development of therapeutic agents. Tumor oxygenation has been shown to be an important indicator of therapeutic response. We report the use of intracellular labeling of tumor cells with perfluorocarbon (PFC) molecules, combined with quantitative (1)(9)F spin-lattice relaxation rate (R(1)) measurements, to assay tumor cell oxygen dynamics in situ. In a murine central nervous system (CNS) GL261 glioma model, we visualized the impact of Pmel-1 cytotoxic T cell immunotherapy, delivered intravenously, on intracellular tumor oxygen levels. GL261 glioma cells were labeled ex vivo with PFC and inoculated into the mouse striatum. The R(1) of (1)(9)F labeled cells was measured using localized single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the absolute intracellular partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) was ascertained. Three days after tumor implantation, mice were treated with 2x10(7) cytotoxic T cells intravenously. At day five, a transient spike in pO(2) was observed indicating an influx of T cells into the CNS and putative tumor cell apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the pO(2) was causally related to the T cells infiltration. Surprisingly, the pO(2) spike was detected even though few ( approximately 4x10(4)) T cells actually ingress into the CNS and with minimal tumor shrinkage. These results indicate the high sensitivity of this approach and its utility as a non-invasive surrogate biomarker of anti-cancer immunotherapeutic response in preclinical models.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy as an early indicator of response to anti-angiogenic therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma: RTOG 0625/ACRIN 6677.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognosis for patients with recurrent glioblastoma remains poor. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential role of MR spectroscopy as an early indicator of response to anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS: Thirteen patients with recurrent glioblastoma were enrolled in RTOG 0625/ACRIN 6677, a prospective multicenter trial in which bevacizumab was used in combination with either temozolomide or irinotecan. Patients were scanned prior to treatment and at specific timepoints during the treatment regimen. Postcontrast T1-weighted MRI was used to assess 6-month progression-free survival. Spectra from the enhancing tumor and peritumoral regions were defined on the postcontrast T1-weighted images. Changes in the concentration ratios of n-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr), choline-containing compounds (Cho)/Cr, and NAA/Cho were quantified in comparison with pretreatment values. RESULTS: NAA/Cho levels increased and Cho/Cr levels decreased within enhancing tumor at 2 weeks relative to pretreatment levels (P = .048 and P = .016, respectively), suggesting a possible antitumor effect of bevacizumab with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Nine of the 13 patients were alive and progression free at 6 months. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves for NAA/Cho changes in tumor at 8 weeks revealed higher levels in patients progression free at 6 months (area under the curve = 0.85), suggesting that NAA/Cho is associated with treatment response. Similar results were observed for receiver operating characteristic curve analyses against 1-year survival. In addition, decreased Cho/Cr and increased NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho in tumor periphery at 16 weeks posttreatment were associated with both 6-month progression-free survival and 1-year survival. CONCLUSION: Changes in NAA and Cho by MR spectroscopy may potentially be useful as imaging biomarkers in assessing response to anti-angiogenic treatment.

Title: Utility of FDG-PETCT and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in differentiating between cerebral lymphoma and non-malignant CNS lesions in HIV-infected patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In HIV infected patients, MRI cannot reliably differentiate between central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and non-malignant CNS lesions, particularly cerebral toxoplasmosis (CTOX). This study prospectively investigates the utility of FDG PET-CT and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in discriminating CNS lymphoma from non-malignant CNS lesions in HIV infected patients, and assesses the ability of FDG PET-CT to guide the use of early brain biopsy. METHODS: 10 HIV patients with neurological symptoms and contrast enhancing lesions on MRI were commenced on anti-toxoplasmosis therapy before undergoing FDG PET-CT and MRS. Brain biopsies were sought in those with FDG PET-CT suggestive of CNS lymphoma, and in those with a negative FDG PET-CT scan who failed to respond to therapy. Final diagnosis was based on histology or treatment response. RESULTS: Two patients were confirmed to have CNS lymphoma and FDG PET-CT was consistent with this diagnosis in both. Six patients had cerebral toxoplasmosis in all of whom FDG PET-CT was consistent with non-malignant disease. One patient had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), FDG PET-CT was equivocal. One patient had a haemorrhagic brain metastasis and FDG PET-CT wrongly suggested non-malignant disease. MRS was performed successfully in eight subjects: three results were suggestive of CNS lymphoma (one true positive, two false positive), four suggested CTOX (two false negative, two true negative), one scan was equivocal. CONCLUSION: FDG PET-CT correctly identified all cases of CNS lymphoma and CTOX, supporting its use in this situation. MRS was unhelpful in our cohort.

Title: 2-hydroxyglutarate as a magnetic resonance biomarker for glioma subtyping.
Abstract: Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes are frequently found in gliomas and in a fraction of acute myeloid leukemia patients. This results in the production of an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Glioma patients harboring IDH mutations have a longer survival than their wild-type counterparts. 2-HG has been detected noninvasively in gliomas with IDH mutations using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), suggesting its potential clinical relevance for identifying glioma subtypes with better prognosis. In this paper, the recent developments in the MRS detection of the 2-HG in gliomas are reviewed, including the therapeutic potentials and translational values.

Title: Lipid and macromolecules quantitation in differentiating glioblastoma from solitary metastasis: a short-echo time single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy study at 3 T.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The differentiation between solitary metastasis (MET) and glioblastoma (GBM) is difficult using only magnetic resonance imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) lipid signal indicates cellular necrosis both in GBMs and METs. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine whether a class of lipids and/or macromolecules (MMs), able to efficiently discriminate between these two types of lesions, exists. METHODS: Forty-one patients with solitary brain tumor (23 GBMs and 18 METs) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and single-voxel MRS. Short-echo time point resolved spectroscopy sequence acquisition with water suppression technique was used. Spectra were analyzed using LCModel. Absolute quantification was performed with "water-scaling" procedure. The analysis was focused on sums of lipid and macromolecular (LM) components at 0.9 and 1.3 ppm. RESULTS: The LM13 absolute concentration was statistically different (P < 0.0001) between GBMs and METs. With a cutoff of 81 mM in LM13 absolute concentration, METs and GBMs can be distinguished with a 78% of specificity and an 81% of sensitivity. The presence of the MM12 peak, related to the fucose II complex, in tumors harboring a K-ras gene mutation has been investigated. CONCLUSIONS: We exploited the performance of a clinically easily implementable method, such as short-echo time single-voxel MRS, for the differentiation between brain metastasis and primary brain tumors. The study showed that MRS absolute lipid and macromolecular signals could be helpful in differentiating GBM from metastasis. LM13 class was found to be a discriminant parameter with an accuracy of 85%. Detection of the MM12-fucose peak may also have a role in understanding molecular biology of brain metastasis and should be further investigated to address specific metabolic phenotypes.

Title: Preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy improves diagnostic accuracy in a series of neurosurgical dilemmas.
Abstract: OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in neurosurgical patients with diagnostically challenging intracranial lesions. METHODS: Included in this study are twenty-three consecutive patients presenting to the neurosurgery service with diagnostically challenging intracranial lesions and who were investigated by conventional MR imaging and proton ((1)H) MRS, followed by surgery with subsequent histopathological diagnosis. An experienced neuroradiologist (RJ) blinded to the final histopathology evaluated the imaging studies retrospectively. Provisional diagnoses based on preoperative clinical and conventional MR data versus preoperative MRS data were compared with definitive histopathological diagnoses. RESULTS: Compared with preoperative clinical and conventional MR data, (1)H MRS improved the accuracy of MR imaging from 60.9% to 83%. We found (1)H MRS reliably distinguished between abscess and high-grade tumour, and between high-grade glioma and low-grade glioma, but was not able to reliably distinguish between recurrent glioma and radiation necrosis. In 12/23 cases (52%) the (1)H MRS findings positively altered our clinical management. Two representative cases are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a beneficial role for (1)H MRS in certain diagnostic intracranial dilemmas presenting to neurosurgeons. The information gleaned from preoperative (1)H MRS can be a useful adjunct to clinical and conventional MR imaging data in guiding the management of patients with intracranial pathologies, particularly high-grade tumour versus abscess, and high-grade versus low-grade glioma. Further larger prospective studies are needed to clearly define the utility of (1)H MRS in diagnostically challenging intracranial lesions in neurosurgery.

Title: Intraoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identification of residual tumor during low-grade glioma surgery: clinical article.
Abstract: OBJECT: The authors had previously shown that 3-T intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) detects residual tumor tissue during low-grade glioma and that it helps to increase the extent of resection. In a proportion of their cases, however, the ioMRI disclosed T2-hyperintense areas at the tumor resection border after the initial resection attempt and prompted a differential diagnosis between residual tumor and nontumoral changes. To guide this differential diagnosis the authors used intraoperative long-TE single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (ioMRS) and tested the correlation of these findings with findings from pathological examination of resected tissue. METHODS: Patients who were undergoing surgery for hemispheric or insular WHO Grade II gliomas and were found to have T2 changes around the resection cavity at the initial ioMRI were prospectively examined with ioMRS and biopsies were taken from corresponding localizations. In 14 consecutive patients, the ioMRS diagnosis in 20 voxels of interest was tested against the histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (ioDWI) was also performed, as a part of the routine imaging, to rule out surgically induced changes, which could also appear as T2 hyperintensity. RESULTS: Presence of tumor was documented in 14 (70%) of the 20 T2-hyperintense areas by histopathological examination. The sensitivity of ioMRS for identifying residual tumor was 85.7%, the specificity was 100%, the positive predictive value was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 75%. The specificity of ioDWI for surgically induced changes was high (100%), but the sensitivity was only 60%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical series to indicate that ioMRS can be used to differentiate residual tumor from nontumoral changes around the resection cavity, with high sensitivity and specificity.

Title: Clinical outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery in the salvage treatment of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previously published randomized evidence did not report a survival advantage for patients diagnosed with grade IV glioma who were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery followed by external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy when compared to patients treated with external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy alone. In recent years, gamma knife radiosurgery has become increasingly popular as a salvage treatment modality for patients diagnosed with recurrent high-grade glioma. The purpose of this article is to review the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery for patients who suffer from this malignancy. METHODS: Retrospective, prospective, and randomized clinical studies published between the years 2000 and 2012 analyzing gamma knife radiosurgery for patients with high-grade glioma were reviewed. RESULTS: After assessing patient age, Karnofsky performance status, tumor histology, and extent of resection, gamma knife radiosurgery is a viable, minimally invasive treatment option for patients diagnosed with recurrent high-grade glioma. The available prospective and retrospective evidence suggests that gamma knife radiosurgery provides patients with a high local tumor control rate and a median survival after tumor recurrence ranging from 13 to 26 months. Gamma knife radiosurgery followed by chemotherapy for recurrent high-grade glioma may provide select patients with increased levels of survival. However, further investigation into this matter is needed due to the limited number of published reports. Additional clinical research is also needed to analyze the efficacy and radiation-related toxicities of fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery due to its potential to limit treatment-associated morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment option for select patients diagnosed with recurrent high-grade glioma. Although treatment outcomes have improved, further evidence in the form of phase III randomized trials is needed to assess the durability of treating patients in specific clinical situations.

Title: Multimodal elucidation of choline metabolism in a murine glioma model using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 11C-choline positron emission tomography.
Abstract: The metabolites, transporters, and enzymes involved in choline metabolism are regarded as biomarkers for disease progression in a variety of cancers, but their in vivo detection is not ideal. Both magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS using chemical shift imaging (CSI) total choline (tCho)] and C-choline positron emission tomography (PET) can probe this pathway, but they have not been compared side by side. In this study, we used the spontaneous murine astrocytoma model SMA560 injected intracranially into syngeneic VM/Dk mice, analyzing animals at various postimplantation time points using dynamic microPET imaging and CSI MRS. We observed an increase in tumor volume and C-choline uptake between days 5 and 18. Similarly, tCho levels decreased at days 5 to 18. We found a negative correlation between the tCho and PET results in the tumor and a positive correlation between the tCho tumor-to-brain ratio and choline uptake in the tumor. PCR results confirmed expected increases in expression levels for most of the transporters and enzymes. Using MRS quantification, a good agreement was found between CSI and C-choline PET data, whereas a negative correlation occurred when CSI was not referenced. Thus, C-choline PET and MRS methods seemed to be complementary in strengths. While advancing tumor proliferation caused an increasing C-choline uptake, gliosis and inflammation potentially accounted for a high peritumoral tCho signal in CSI, as supported by histology and secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging. Our findings provide definitive evidence of the use of MRS, CSI, and PET for imaging tumors in vivo.

Title: Automated differentiation of glioblastomas from intracranial metastases using 3T MR spectroscopic and perfusion data.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Differentiation of glioblastomas from metastases is clinical important, but may be difficult even for expert observers. To investigate the contribution of machine learning algorithms in the differentiation of glioblastomas multiforme (GB) from metastases, we developed and tested a pattern recognition system based on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single and multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI scans were performed on 49 patients with solitary brain tumors (35 glioblastoma multiforme and 14 metastases). Metabolic (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, (Lip [Formula: see text] Lac)/Cr) and perfusion (rCBV) parameters were measured in both intratumoral and peritumoral regions. The statistical significance of these parameters was evaluated. For the classification procedure, three datasets were created to find the optimum combination of parameters that provides maximum differentiation. Three machine learning methods were utilized: Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbor (KNN). The discrimination ability of each classifier was evaluated with quantitative performance metrics. RESULTS: Glioblastoma and metastases were differentiable only in the peritumoral region of these lesions ([Formula: see text]). SVM achieved the highest overall performance (accuracy 98%) for both the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Naive-Bayes and KNN presented greater variations in performance. The proper selection of datasets plays a very significant role as they are closely correlated to the underlying pathophysiology. CONCLUSION: The application of pattern recognition techniques using 3T MR-based perfusion and metabolic features may provide incremental diagnostic value in the differentiation of common intraaxial brain tumors, such as glioblastoma versus metastasis.

Title: Recapitulation of tumor heterogeneity and molecular signatures in a 3D brain cancer model with decreased sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibition.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Physiologically relevant pre-clinical ex vivo models recapitulating CNS tumor micro-environmental complexity will aid development of biologically-targeted agents. We present comprehensive characterization of tumor aggregates generated using the 3D Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS). METHODS: CNS cancer cell lines were grown in conventional 2D cultures and the RCCS and comparison with a cohort of 53 pediatric high grade gliomas conducted by genome wide gene expression and microRNA arrays, coupled with immunohistochemistry, ex vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy and drug sensitivity evaluation using the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Vorinostat. RESULTS: Macroscopic RCCS aggregates recapitulated the heterogeneous morphology of brain tumors with a distinct proliferating rim, necrotic core and oxygen tension gradient. Gene expression and microRNA analyses revealed significant differences with 3D expression intermediate to 2D cultures and primary brain tumors. Metabolic profiling revealed differential profiles, with an increase in tumor specific metabolites in 3D. To evaluate the potential of the RCCS as a drug testing tool, we determined the efficacy of Vorinostat against aggregates of U87 and KNS42 glioblastoma cells. Both lines demonstrated markedly reduced sensitivity when assaying in 3D culture conditions compared to classical 2D drug screen approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive characterization demonstrates that 3D RCCS culture of high grade brain tumor cells has profound effects on the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic profiles of cultured cells, with these cells residing as an intermediate phenotype between that of 2D cultures and primary tumors. There is a discrepancy between 2D culture and tumor molecular profiles, and RCCS partially re-capitulates tissue specific features, allowing drug testing in a more relevant ex vivo system.

Title: Potential of MR spectroscopy for assessment of glioma grading.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an imaging diagnostic method based that allows non-invasive measurement of metabolites in tissues. There are a number of metabolites that can be identified by standard brain proton MRS but only a few of them has a clinical significance in diagnosis of gliomas including N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, myo-inositol, lactate, and lipids. METHODS: In this review, we describe potential of MRS for grading of gliomas. RESULTS: Low-grade gliomas are generally characterized by a relatively high concentration of N-acetylaspartate, low level of choline and absence of lactate and lipids. The increase in creatine concentration indicates low-grade gliomas with earlier progression and malignant transformation. Progression in grade of a glioma is reflected in the progressive decrease in the N-acetylaspartate and myo-inositol levels on the one hand and elevation in choline level up to grade III on the other. Malignant transformation of the glial tumors is also accompanied by the presence of lactate and lipids in MR spectra of grade III but mainly grade IV gliomas. It follows that MRS is a helpful method for detection of glioma regions with aggressive growth or upgrading due to favorable correlation of the choline and N-acetylaspartate levels with histopathological proliferation index Ki-67. Thus, magnetic resonance spectroscopy is also a suitable method for the targeting of brain biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Gliomas of each grade have some specific MRS features that can be used for improvement of the diagnostic value of conventional magnetic resonance imaging in non-invasive assessment of glioma grade.

Title: Complementary effect of H MRS in diagnosis of suprasellar tumors.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Suprasellar tumors are considered exceptionally important in neurosurgical practice due to their proximity to vital portions of the brain. Predicting histology of these tumors is of prime importance in determining the surgical approach, prognosis, and probable postoperative complications. There are numerous cases where computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fail to predict histology. We have studied the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the diagnosis of suprasellar tumors. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with primary nonfunctional suprasellar tumors and high-quality magnetic resonance spectra were studied. The most probable diagnosis (adenoma, meningioma, craniopharyngioma, or astrocytoma) was made by a neuroradiologist based on the MRI findings and then based on MRI plus MRS findings. Finally, the results were compared with the pathology report. RESULTS: The information provided by MRS led the radiologist to alter his prior diagnosis that was based on the MRI in four patients, and the final diagnoses were in accordance with the histopathology. Wrong diagnosis was made by MRI plus MRS in three patients. Test efficiency of MRI was 69.6%, and it was 87% for MRI plus MRS. However, the difference was not statistically significant (P value=.152). CONCLUSION: MRS may be useful in providing a more improved preoperative diagnosis of suprasellar tumors.

Title: Differentiation of glioblastoma multiforme from metastatic brain tumor using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion metrics at 3 T.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the contribution of (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSCE) imaging metrics in the differentiation of glioblastomas from solitary metastasis, and particularly to clarify the controversial reports regarding the hypothesis that there should be a significant differentiation between the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. METHODS: Conventional MR imaging, (1)H-MRS, DWI, DTI and DSCE MRI was performed on 49 patients (35 glioblastomas multiforme, 14 metastases) using a 3.0-T MR unit. Metabolite ratios, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were measured in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of the lesions. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to obtain the cut-off values for the parameters presenting a statistical difference between the two tumor groups. Furthermore, we investigated the potential effect of the region of interest (ROI) size on the quantification of diffusion properties in the intratumoral region of the lesions, by applying two different ROI methods. RESULTS: Peritumoral N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), choline (Cho)/Cr, Cho/NAA and rCBV significantly differentiated glioblastomas from intracranial metastases. ADC and FA presented no significant difference between the two tumor groups. CONCLUSIONS: 1H-MRS and dynamic susceptibility measurements in the peritumoral regions may definitely aid in the differentiation of glioblastomas and solitary metastases. The quantification of the diffusion properties in the intratumoral region is independent of the ROI size placed.

Title: Detection of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid in vivo by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in U87 glioma cells overexpressing isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutation.
Abstract: The arginine 132 (R132) mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase -1 (IDH1(R132)) results in production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and is associated with a better prognosis compared with wild-type (WT) in glioma patients. The majority of lower-grade gliomas express IDH1(R132), whereas this mutation is rare in grade IV gliomas. The aim of this study was to noninvasively investigate metabolic and physiologic changes associated with the IDH1 mutation in a mouse glioma model. Using a 7T magnet, we compared MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in U87 glioma cells overexpressing either the mutated IDH1(R132) or IDH1 wild-type (IDH1(WT)) gene in a mouse flank xenograft model. Flank tumors overexpressing IDH1(R132) showed a resonance at 2.25 ppm corresponding to the 2-HG peak described for human IDH1(R132) gliomas. WT tumors lacked this peak in all cases. IDH1 mutant tumors demonstrated significantly reduced glutamate by in vivo MRS. There were no significant differences in T(2), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), or perfusion values between the mutant and IDH1(WT) tumors. The IDH1(R132) mutation results in 2-HG resonance at 2.25 ppm and a reduction of glutamate levels as determined by MRS. Our results establish a model system where 2-HG can be monitored noninvasively, which should be helpful in validating 2-HG levels as a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker in glioma.

Title: Bcl-2 rs956572 polymorphism is associated with increased anterior cingulate cortical glutamate in euthymic bipolar I disorder.
Abstract: B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) is an important regulator of cellular plasticity and resilience. In bipolar disorder (BD), studies have shown a key role for a Bcl-2 gene single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs956572 in the regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) dynamics, Bcl-2 expression/levels, and vulnerability to cellular apoptosis. At the same time, Bcl-2 decreases glutamate (Glu) toxicity in neural cells. Abnormalities in Glu function have been implicated in BD. In magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies, anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) Glu levels have been reported to be increased in bipolar depression and mania, but no study specifically evaluated ACC Glu levels in BD-euthymia. Here, we compared ACC Glu levels in BD-euthymia compared with healthy subjects using (1)H-MRS and also evaluated the selective role of the rs956572 Bcl-2 SNP in modulating ACC Glu and Glx (sum of Glu and glutamine) in euthymic-BD. Forty euthymic subjects with BD type I and forty healthy controls aged 18-40 were evaluated. All participants were genotyped for Bcl-2 rs956572 and underwent a 3-Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging examination including the acquisition of an in vivo PRESS single voxel (2 cm(3)) (1)H-MRS sequence to obtain metabolite levels from the ACC. Euthymic-BD subjects had higher Glu/Cre (creatine) and Glx/Cre compared with healthy controls. The Bcl-2 SNP AA genotype was associated with elevated ACC Glu/Cre and Glx/Cre ratio in the BD group but not in controls. The present study reports for the first time an increase in ACC Glu/Cre and Glx/Cre ratios in BD-euthymia. Also, Bcl-2 AA genotype, previously associated with lower Bcl-2 expression and increase intracellular Ca(2+), showed to be associated with increased ACC Glu and Glx levels in euthymic-BD subjects. The present findings reinforce a key role for glutamatergic system dysfunction in the pathophysiology of BD, potentially involving modulatory effects by Bcl-2 in the ACC.

Title: Preoperative assessment using multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques in patients with brain gliomas.
Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), blood oxygen level-dependent imaging (BOLD) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for preoperative assessment in patients with brain gliomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive glioma patients underwent MRS, BOLD and DTI before operation. The characteristics of images were analysed according to histopathological results. RESULTS: There is significant elevation of the choline (Cho) /creatine (Cr) ratio, Cho peak and depression of the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak in gliomas. Elevation of the Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA ratio and the presence of a lipids peak, were consistent with high-grade malignancy. A motor activation scan was achieved by using a motor task paradigm in 20 patients. Deformation and displacement of the motor activations was found in 5 cases. The margin of tumor and peritumoural white matter tracts were identified using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Three patterns of white matter tracts alteration were identified: displacement, infiltration, and disruption. In all 23 patients, the tumors were completely resected in 6 patients, subtotal resected in 8 patients, partial resected in 9 patients. No secondary neurological deficit was occurred in all patients after operation. CONCLUSION: The combination of MRS, BOLD, and DTI techniques allows appropriate presurgical planning of brain gliomas.

Title: MRS study of meningeal hemangiopericytoma and edema: a comparison with meningothelial meningioma.
Abstract: Intracranial hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare tumors and their radiological appearance resembles that of meningiomas, especially meningothelial meningiomas. To increase the knowledge on the biochemical composition of this type of tumor for better diagnosis and prognosis, we performed a molecular study using ex vivo high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) perfomed on HPC and peritumoral edematous tissues. Moreover, to help in the discrimination between HPC and meningothelial meningioma we compared the ex vivo HR-MAS spectra of samples from one patient with HPC and 5 patients affected by meningothelial meningioma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in vivo localized single voxel 1H-MRS was also performed on the same patients prior to surgery and the in vivo and ex vivo MRS spectra were compared. We observed the presence of OH-butyrate, together with glucose in HPC and a low amount of N-acetylaspartate in the edema, that may reflect neuronal alteration responsible for associated epilepsy. Many differences between HPC and meningothelial meningioma were identified. The relative ratios of myo-inositol, glucose and gluthatione with respect to glutamate are higher in HPC compared to meningioma; whereas the relative ratios of creatine, glutamine, alanine, glycine and choline-containing compounds with respect to glutamate are lower in HPC compared to meningioma. These data will be useful to improve the interpretation of in vivo MRS spectra resulting in a more accurate diagnosis of these rare tumors.

Title: Insufficiency of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma of the central nervous system.
Abstract: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVL) is a rare type of extranodal lymphoma with an aggressive clinical course characterized by the proliferation of lymphoma cells within the lumen of small vessels. Diagnosis is often difficult because of marked variability in clinical presentation and nonspecific laboratory and radiological findings, especially when central nervous system (CNS) symptoms are the only manifestation. Modern metabolic imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of conventional primary CNS lymphoma. We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented with a progressive leukoencephalopathic syndrome. The patient was examined by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (11)C-methionine PET and MRS, but none of these examinations were able to show the presence of a tumor in the lesions or to clarify the tumor characteristics. Brain biopsy was the only way to obtain a definite diagnosis of IVL. The patient was treated intensively with standard immunochemotherapy but died 6 months after the diagnosis. Here, we discuss the insufficiency of modern metabolic imaging techniques, including PET and MRS, and recommend a rapid decision of brain biopsy in the diagnosis of IVL only involving the CNS.

Title: Sci-Fri PM: Delivery - 09: Response of a tumor xenograft model to radiation therapy using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: 9.4T (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was utilized to track the response of mouse xenograft glioblastoma multiform (GBM) brain tumors to single fraction radiation therapy. Six metabolites were analyzed with LCModel: alanine (Ala), myo-inositol (Ins), taurine (Tau), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr + PCr), glutamine and glutamate (Glu + Gln), and total choline (glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine) (GPC + PCh). 11 mice received 800 cGy of 200 kVp x-rays, 5 were untreated controls. PRESS spectra (27 muL volumes) were acquired at multiple time points for treated and control animals. In treated animals, all metabolite : water ratios decreased 3 days post-treatment, with further decreases at day 7, and then increases at day 14 relative to the 7 day mark. Concentrations on day 7 relative to pre-treatment were as follows: 0.42 (Ala), 0.43 (Ins), 0.68 (Tau), 0.52 (GPC+PCh), 0.49 (Cr + PCr) and 0.78 (Glu + Gln). Metabolite ratios did not correlate with tumor volume in control animals, suggesting a real therapeutic response was observed. Our (1) H MRS data suggests that perturbations in the metabolic signature of GBM cancers occur in response to irradiation. Such changes in the metabolite : water concentration ratios could potentially be exploited for the improvement of radiotherapy.

Title: Single- and multivoxel proton spectroscopy in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of two magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques for treating pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) and to evaluate the relationship of metabolic profiles determined by each technique. Utility of each technique for improving patient management is also discussed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Children with DIPG (n = 36) were evaluated using single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) during the same imaging session. Patients were followed longitudinally (n = 150 total studies). Technical feasibility was defined by sufficient water and lipid suppression for detection of metabolites. Correlation of metabolic data obtained by SVS and MRSI was determined using the Spearman rank method. Metabolite ratios, including choline:N-acetyl-aspartate (Cho:NAA) and Cho:creatine (Cho:Cr), were obtained from SVS and MRSI. RESULTS: SVS and MRSI acquisitions were feasible in >90% of studies. Maximum Cho:NAA and Cho:Cr from MRSI analysis were strongly associated with Cho:NAA and Cho:Cr obtained by SVS (r = 0.67 and 0.76, respectively). MRSI Cho:NAA values were more heterogeneous than Cho:Cr values within the same lesion, and a strong linear relationship between the range and maximum Cho:NAA values was observed. CONCLUSIONS: SVS and MRSI acquisitions were feasible, with a strong correlation in metabolic data. Both techniques may improve diagnostic evaluation and management of DIPG. SVS is recommended for global assessment of tumor metabolism before and after therapy. MRSI showed heterogeneous patterns of metabolic activity within these tumors and is recommended for planning and monitoring targeted therapies and evaluating nearby tissue for tumor invasion.

Title: Phase II trial of radiosurgery to magnetic resonance spectroscopy-defined high-risk tumor volumes in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of a Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) boost to areas of high risk determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) functional imaging in addition to standard radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-five patients in this prospective Phase II trial underwent surgical resection or biopsy for a GBM followed by SRS directed toward areas of MRS-determined high biological activity within 2 cm of the postoperative enhancing surgical bed. The MRS regions were determined by identifying those voxels within the postoperative T2 magnetic resonance imaging volume that contained an elevated choline/N-acetylaspartate ratio in excess of 2:1. These voxels were marked, digitally fused with the SRS planning magnetic resonance image, targeted with an 8-mm isocenter per voxel, and treated using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group SRS dose guidelines. All patients then received conformal radiotherapy to a total dose of 60 Gy in 2-Gy daily fractions. The primary endpoint was overall survival. RESULTS: The median survival for the entire cohort was 15.8 months. With 75% of recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class 3 patients still alive 18 months after treatment, the median survival for RPA Class 3 has not yet been reached. The median survivals for RPA Class 4, 5, and 6 patients were 18.7, 12.5, and 3.9 months, respectively, compared with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiotherapy-alone historical control survivals of 11.1, 8.9, and 4.6 months. For the 16 of 35 patients who received concurrent temozolomide in addition to protocol radiotherapeutic treatment, the median survival was 20.8 months, compared with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer historical controls of 14.6 months using radiotherapy and temozolomide. Grade 3/4 toxicities possibly attributable to treatment were 11%. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first prospective trial using selective MRS-targeted functional SRS combined with radiotherapy for patients with GBM. This treatment is feasible, with acceptable toxicity and patient survivals higher than in historical controls. This study can form the basis for a multicenter, randomized trial.

Title: Noninvasive evaluation of cerebral glioma grade by using diffusion-weighted imaging-guided single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-guided, single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SVS) for preoperative evaluation of cerebral glioma grade. METHODS: For SVS, placement of volume-of-interest was guided by the minimal apparent diffusion coefficient value obtained from DWI. Spectral data for N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and phosphocreatine (Cr) were analysed in 33 patients with primary gliomas. RESULTS: Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios were significantly higher in high-grade than in low-grade gliomas; NAA/Cr ratios were significantly lower in high-grade than in low-grade gliomas. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated a threshold value of 2.01 for Cho/Cr for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of 86.36%, 90.00%, 95.00% and 75.00%, respectively. Threshold values of 2.49 and 0.97 were obtained for Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr, respectively. Despite no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the metabolite ratios, diagnostic accuracy using the Cho/Cr ratio was slightly better than that of Cho/NAA or NAA/Cr. CONCLUSION: DWI-guided SVS has potential value for the preoperative prediction of glioma grade.

Title: The use of neuroimaging to guide the histologic diagnosis of central nervous system lesions.
Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging, have led to substantially improved spatial anatomic resolution such that subtle or small central nervous system lesions, which could go undetected on gross examination of brain sections, are now readily identified on imaging. Although neuroimaging is generally considered the surrogate of gross neuropathology, it is still not a substitute for tissue diagnosis. Rather, it can be a valuable tool for the surgical pathologist in the process of formulating a differential diagnosis based on location and imaging features, as well as in identifying radiologic/pathologic discordance, such as the possible undersampling of a heterogenous glioma, which could lead to underestimation of the tumor grade. The following review focuses on the application of neuroimaging techniques, mainly magnetic resonance imaging, to the histologic diagnosis of central nervous system lesions, and the correlation of imaging features of infiltrative gliomas with histologic findings pertinent to tumor grading. The use of advanced functional magnetic resonance methods, specifically diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy is also discussed, as well as the common pitfalls in imaging interpretation.

Title: Distinct peak at 3.8 ppm observed by 3T MR spectroscopy in meningiomas, while nearly absent in high-grade gliomas and cerebral metastases.
Abstract: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate distinct metabolic features of meningiomas to distinguish them from other brain lesions using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study was performed on 17 meningiomas, 24 high-grade gliomas and 9 metastases. Elevated signal intensity at 3.8 ppm observed in low TE spectra adequately differentiated meningioma from other brain tumors while alanine was not indicative of meningioma occurrence; the presence of lipids and lactate did not provide a strong index for meningioma malignancy.

Title: Minimization of spectral pattern changes during HRMAS experiments at 37 degrees celsius by prior focused microwave irradiation.
Abstract: OBJECT: High-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides detailed metabolomic information from intact tissue. However, long acquisition times and high rotation speed may lead to timedependent spectral pattern changes, which may affect proper interpretation of results. We report a strategy to minimize those changes, even at physiological recording temperature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Glioblastoma(Gbm) tumours were induced in 12 mice by stereotactic injection of GL261 cells. Animals were sacrificed and tumours were removed and stored in liquid N2. Half of the samples were exposed to focused microwave (FMW) irradiation prior to HRMAS while the other half was not. Time-course experiments (374 min at 37 degrees C, 9.4T, 3,000 Hz spinning rate) were carried out to monitor spectral pattern changes. Differences were assessed with Unianova test while post-HRMAS histopathology analysis was performed to assess tissue integrity. RESULTS: Significant changes (up to 1.7 fold) were observed in samples without FMW irradiation in several spectral regions e.g. mobile lipids/lactate (0.90-1.30 ppm), acetate (1.90 ppm), N-acetyl aspartate (2.00 ppm), and Choline-containing compounds (3.19-3.25 ppm). No significant changes in the spectral pattern of FMW-irradiated samples were recorded. CONCLUSION: We describe here a successful strategy to minimize spectral pattern changes in mouse Gbm samples using a FMW irradiation system.

Title: Detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH-mutated glioma patients by in vivo spectral-editing and 2D correlation magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Mutations in the gene isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are present in up to 86% of grade II and III gliomas and secondary glioblastoma. Arginine 132 (R132) mutations in the enzyme IDH1 result in excess production of the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which could be used as a biomarker for this subset of gliomas. Here, we use optimized in vivo spectral-editing and two-dimensional (2D) correlation magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods to unambiguously detect 2HG noninvasively in glioma patients with IDH1 mutations. By comparison, fitting of conventional 1D MR spectra can provide false-positive readouts owing to spectral overlap of 2HG and chemically similar brain metabolites, such as glutamate and glutamine. 2HG was also detected using 2D high-resolution magic angle spinning MRS performed ex vivo on a separate set of glioma biopsy samples. 2HG detection by in vivo or ex vivo MRS enabled detailed molecular characterization of a clinically important subset of human gliomas. This has implications for diagnosis as well as monitoring of treatments targeting mutated IDH1.

Title: (1)H MR Spectroscopy of Meningiomas at 3.0T: the Role of Glutamate-Glutamine Complex and Glutathione.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) has been used extensively for the characterization of the intracranial meningiomas. A major emphasis is placed on identification of an alanine (Ala) content within these tumors. Less attention is given to other metabolites such as glutamine and glutamate (Glx). Our objective was to assess the incidence and the relevance of the Glx content in meningiomas, to evaluate their usefulness versus Ala in the diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas and to indicate a potential role of other biochemical compounds such as glutathione (GSH). We performed a retrospective review of the (1)H MRS spectra at 3.0T of 16 intracranial meningiomas in 16 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed tumors. All meningiomas were evaluated with single- voxel (1)H MRS at short echo time using an automatic quantitation of the metabolites by linear combination model (LCModel) fitting. Detailed analysis of the spectra showed that the Glx content was a more common result (100%) than the Ala content (44%). The Glx content can be considered in high concentrations within these tumors resulting in overall levels comparable to normal brain values (P > 0.2). A glutathione (GSH) spectrum was added to the LCModel basis set in six meningiomas and in all of them a GSH peak was detected at 2.95 ppm (100%). Other metabolites such as guanidinoacetate (Gua) were detected in six meningiomas (38%) and this was not reported previously. Our data indicate that Glx and GSH are far more likely to be biochemical predictors than Ala in the (1)H MRS evaluation of intracranial meningiomas. The significance of Gua as another potential marker of the meningioma cell metabolism needs to be further investigated.

Title: Histone deacetylase inhibition increases levels of choline kinase alpha and phosphocholine facilitating noninvasive imaging in human cancers.
Abstract: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are currently approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and are in mid-late stage trials for other cancers. The HDAC inhibitors LAQ824 and SAHA increase phosphocholine (PC) levels in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts as observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In this study, we show that belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor with an alternative chemical scaffold, also caused a rise in cellular PC content that was detectable by (1)H and (31)P MRS in prostate and colon carcinoma cells. In addition, (1)H MRS showed an increase in branched chain amino acid and alanine concentrations. (13)C-choline labeling indicated that the rise in PC resulted from increased de novo synthesis and correlated with an induction of choline kinase alpha expression. Furthermore, metabolic labeling experiments with (13)C-glucose showed that differential glucose routing favored alanine formation at the expense of lactate production. Additional analysis revealed increases in the choline/water and phosphomonoester (including PC)/total phosphate ratios in vivo. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of HDAC inhibition on cancer cell metabolism and highlight PC as a candidate noninvasive imaging biomarker for monitoring the action of HDAC inhibitors.

Title: Reduced phosphocholine and hyperpolarized lactate provide magnetic resonance biomarkers of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition in glioblastoma.
Abstract: The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathway is activated in more than88% of glioblastomas (GBM). New drugs targeting this pathway are currently in clinical trials. However, noninvasive assessment of treatment response remains challenging. By using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition was monitored in 3 GBM cell lines (GS-2, GBM8, and GBM6; each with a distinct pathway activating mutation) through the measurement of 2 mechanistically linked MR biomarkers: phosphocholine (PC) and hyperpolarized lactate.(31)P MRS studies showed that treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induced significant decreases in PC to 34 %+/- 9% of control in GS-2 cells, 48% +/- 5% in GBM8, and 45% +/- 4% in GBM6. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus also induced a significant decrease in PC to 62% +/- 14%, 57% +/- 1%, and 58% +/- 1% in GS-2, GBM8, and GBM6 cells, respectively. Using hyperpolarized (13)C MRS, we demonstrated that hyperpolarized lactate levels were significantly decreased following PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition in all 3 cell lines to 51% +/- 10%, 62% +/- 3%, and 58% +/- 2% of control with LY294002 and 72% +/- 3%, 61% +/- 2%, and 66% +/- 3% of control with everolimus in GS-2, GBM8, and GBM6 cells, respectively. These effects were mediated by decreases in the activity and expression of choline kinase alpha and lactate dehydrogenase, which respectively control PC and lactate production downstream of HIF-1. Treatment with the DNA damaging agent temozolomide did not have an effect on either biomarker in any cell line. This study highlights the potential of PC and hyperpolarized lactate as noninvasive MR biomarkers of response to targeted inhibitors in GBM.

Title: Proton MR spectroscopy in predicting the increase of perfusion MR imaging for WHO grade II gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between the metabolite ratios obtained from proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and those obtained from MR perfusion parameters (relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV]) in a cohort of low-grade glioma (LGG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent prospectively conventional MR, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) HMRS), and perfusion-weighted images (PWI). Statistical analyses were performed to determine the correlative and independent predictive factors of rCBVmax and the metabolite ratio thresholds with optimum sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included in this study. Linear correlations were observed between the metabolic ratios (lactate [Lac]/creatine [Cr], choline [Cho]/N-acetyl-aspartate [NAA], free-lipids/Cr) and rCBVmax (P < 0.05). These metabolic ratios were determined to be independent predictive factors of rCBVmax (P = 0.027, 0.011 and 0.032, respectively). According to the receiver operating characteristic curves, the cutoff values of the metabolic ratios to discriminate between the two populations of rCBVmax (<1.7 versus = 1.7) were 1.72, 1.54, and 1.40, respectively, with a sensitivity = 75% and a specificity >95% for Lac/Cr. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated consistent correlations between the data from (1) HMRS and PWI. The Lac/Cr ratio predicts regional hemodynamic changes, which are themselves a useful biomarker of clinical prognosis in patients with LGG. As such, this ratio may provide a new parameter for making improved clinical decisions.

Title: Non-invasive detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate and other metabolites in IDH1 mutant glioma patients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 genes (IDH1 and IDH2) are commonly found in primary brain cancers. We previously reported that a novel enzymatic activity of these mutations results in the production of the putative oncometabolite, R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Here we investigated the ability of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect 2-HG production in order to non-invasively identify patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. Patients with intrinsic glial brain tumors (n = 27) underwent structural and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging prior to surgery. 2-HG levels from MRS data were quantified using LC-Model software, based upon a simulated spectrum obtained from a GAMMA library added to the existing prior knowledge database. The resected tumors were then analyzed for IDH1 mutational status by genomic DNA sequencing, Ki-67 proliferation index by immunohistochemistry, and concentrations of 2-HG and other metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). MRS detected elevated 2-HG levels in gliomas with IDH1 mutations compared to those with wild-type IDH1 (P = 0.003). The 2-HG levels measured in vivo with MRS were significantly correlated with those measured ex vivo from the corresponding tumor samples using LC-MS (r (2) = 0.56; P = 0.0001). Compared with wild-type tumors, those with IDH1 mutations had elevated choline (P = 0.01) and decreased glutathione (P = 0.03) on MRS. Among the IDH1 mutated gliomas, quantitative 2-HG values were correlated with the Ki-67 proliferation index of the tumors (r ( 2 ) = 0.59; P = 0.026). In conclusion, water-suppressed proton ((1)H) MRS provides a non-invasive measure of 2-HG in gliomas, and may serve as a potential biomarker for patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. In addition to 2-HG, alterations in several other metabolites measured by MRS correlate with IDH1 mutation status.

Title: Changes in serial magnetic resonance spectroscopy predict outcome in high-grade glioma during and after postoperative radiotherapy.
Abstract: AIM: To determine any correlation between magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) pattern of high-grade glioma before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT) with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients prospectively underwent surgery and RT to 60 Gy. MRS was performed before RT, at week 4 of RT, and 2 months post-RT. Normalized and relative metabolite ratios were evaluated. Patients were grouped according to similar evolving MRS patterns and analyzed for differences in OS and PFS. RESULTS: Significant decreases in tumor choline/N-acetyl-aspartate and normalized choline were observed from baseline to post-RT. After a median follow-up of 22.9 months, patients with >40% decrease in normalized choline from week 4 during RT to 2 months post-RT had a significantly worse median OS (9.1 months vs. not reached, p<0.00001) and PFS (5.8 vs. 19.8 months, p=0.0018). CONCLUSION: The change in normalized choline at 2 months post-RT was highly prognostic for PFS and OS. This may allow more individualized response-based treatment.

Title: Glioma residual or recurrence versus radiation necrosis: accuracy of pentavalent technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid [Tc-99m (V) DMSA] brain SPECT compared to proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS): initial results.
Abstract: We compared pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m (V) DMSA) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for the detection of residual or recurrent gliomas after surgery and radiotherapy. A total of 24 glioma patients, previously operated upon and treated with radiotherapy, were studied. SPECT was acquired 2-3 h post-administration of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m (V) DMSA. Lesion to normal (L/N) delayed uptake ratio was calculated as: mean counts of tumor ROI (L)/mean counts of normal mirror symmetric ROI (N). (1)H-MRS was performed using a 1.5-T scanner equipped with a spectroscopy package. SPECT and (1)H-MRS results were compared with pathology or follow-up neuroimaging studies. SPECT and (1)H-MRS showed concordant residue or recurrence in 9/24 (37.5%) patients. Both were true negative in 6/24 (25%) patients. SPECT and (1)H-MRS disagreed in 9 recurrences [7/9 (77.8%) and 2/9 (22.2%) were true positive by SPECT and (1)H-MRS, respectively]. Sensitivity of SPECT and (1)H-MRS in detecting recurrence was 88.8 and 61.1% with accuracies of 91.6 and 70.8%, respectively. A positive association between the delayed L/N ratio and tumor grade was found; the higher the grade, the higher is the L/N ratio (r = 0.62, P = 0.001). Tc-99m (V) DMSA brain SPECT is more accurate compared to (1)H-MRS for the detection of tumor residual tissues or recurrence in glioma patients with previous radiotherapy. It allows early and non-invasive differentiation of residual tumor or recurrence from irradiation necrosis.

Title: Tectal plate glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tectal plate tumors have traditionally been considered low-grade, indolent lesions. We report a patient who presented with a tectal region glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a rare pathology in this anatomic location. CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a case report of a 45-year-old female that presented with worsening confusion, memory loss, and loss of bladder control for 3 days. There was no family history of brain malignancy. The patient presented with Parinaud's phenomenon. Pronator drift was not present. The patient had dysarthric speech. An elevated white blood cell count was also noted. Non-contrast CT scan of the head showed the presence of a tectal region mass and hydrocephalus. A follow-up MRI with and without contrast confirmed the presence of a 4.2 x 3.3 x 4.6 cm(3) mass. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) demonstrated an elevated choline/N-acetylaspartate ratio and an increase in lactate suggesting an aggressive neoplasm. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was initially placed to relieve the hydrocephalus. The patient subsequently underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for debulking of tumor and for tissue diagnosis. Pathology of the lesion was consistent with GBM. The patient declined postoperative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. CONCLUSION: Although tectal region masses are predominantly low-grade lesions, high-grade lesions can present in this anatomical location. Furthermore, MRS can help to differentiate benign lesions from more aggressive lesions in the tectal plate. Biopsy of tectal plate lesions should be considered in select cases to establish diagnosis and prognosis in order to optimize treatment.

Title: In vivo metabolic profiling of glioma-initiating cells using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 14.1 Tesla.
Abstract: In the last decade, evidence has emerged indicating that the growth of a vast majority of tumors including gliomas is sustained by a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell properties called cancer initiating cells. These cells are able to initiate and propagate tumors and constitute only a fraction of all tumor cells. In the present study, we showed that intracerebral injection of cultured glioma-initiating cells into nude mice produced fast growing tumors showing necrosis and gadolinium enhancement in MR images, whereas gliomas produced by injecting freshly purified glioma-initiating cells grew slowly and showed no necrosis and very little gadolinium enhancement. Using proton localized spectroscopy at 14.1 Tesla, decreasing trends of N-acetylaspartate, glutamate and glucose concentrations and an increasing trend of glycine concentration were observed near the injection site after injecting cultured glioma-initiating cells. In contrast to the spectra of tumors grown from fresh cells, those from cultured cells showed intense peaks of lipids, increased absolute concentrations of glycine and choline-containing compounds, and decreased concentrations of glutamine, taurine and total creatine, when compared with a contralateral non-tumor-bearing brain tissue. A decrease in concentrations of N-acetylaspartate and gamma-aminobutyrate was found in both tumor phenotypes after solid tumor formation. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the dissimilarities between the tumors grown from cultured glioma-initiating cells and those from freshly purified glioma-initiating cells, both derived from human glioblastomas.

Title: Frameless stereotactic cerebral biopsy: our experience in 296 cases.
Abstract: AIMS: To evaluate the reliability, safety and accuracy of a the frameless stereotactic system in our clinical series and the differences between head fixation by means of a standard Mayfield head holder and the pinless FESS frame, and to evaluate the usefulness of biopsy targeting on the basis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. METHODS: The spectroscopic analysis was used to facilitate the targeting of the lesion. The fusion image function embedded in the Neuronavigation Unit was used postoperatively to assess the level of accuracy of the biopsy. The grading of the glioma specimens was correlated to the spectroscopic data. RESULTS: 296 patients underwent cerebral biopsy in 8 years. The diagnostic yield was 99.7%. The spectroscopic choline/N-acetyl aspartate ratio in different areas of the same tumor correlated well with the histological grading of the lesion. CONCLUSION: The frameless stereotactic systems guarantee excellent biopsy results. Advanced imaging, in particular MRS, facilitates the correct targeting of nonenhancing lesions.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in radiotherapy planning for recurrent glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how incorporation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) into radiotherapy planning would increase the target volume for patients with recurrent glioma. METHODS: After prior standard radiotherapy, 25 patients with recurrent glioma were treated with bevacizumab and concurrent hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT), delivering 30 Gy in five fractions. MRSI were acquired for 12 patients. Areas with markedly higher choline levels relative to the levels of total creatine and N-acetylaspartate were identified and referred to as MRSI voxels with elevated metabolite ratios (EMR). Gross tumor volume (GTV) consisted of contrast-enhancing tumor on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) and computed tomography. Clinical target volume (CTV) was GTV + 5 mm margin and MRSI voxels with EMR. Overall survival (OS) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS) for these patients were reported in a prior publication [Gutin et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 75(1), 156-163 (2009)], and the outcome was correlated with the GTV and the volume of MRSI voxels with EMR in this study. RESULTS: Seven of the 12 patients had MRSI voxels with EMR. If none of the MRSI voxels with EMR were included, the CTV would range from 9.2 to 73.0 cm3 with a median of 31.0 cm3, whereas if all voxels were included, the CTV would range from 27.4 to 74.4 cm3 with a median of 35.0 cm3. For three of the seven patients, including the voxels with EMR, would have increased the CTV by 14%-23%. For one patient, where the MRSI voxels with EMR did not overlap the GTV, including these voxels would increase the CTV by 198%. No correlation could be found between the OS and PFS and the GTV or the volume of MRSI voxels with EMR. CONCLUSIONS: Seven of 12 patients with recurrent glioma had MRSI voxels with EMR. For four of these seven patients, including the MRSI voxels with EMR, significantly increased the CTV. This study does not have statistical power to conclude on the importance of including areas with MRSI-suspect disease into the radiation target volume.

Title: Elevated citrate in pediatric astrocytomas with malignant progression.
Abstract: In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides information about metabolite concentrations in tissue. Recently citrate was detected by MRS in subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. Citrate is an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and accumulates in tissue when the glycolytic rate exceeds the TCA cycle activity, a feature of malignant tumors. Currently, no practical indicators allow clinicians to predict risk for malignant progression of pediatric astrocytomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade II). Medical records and citrate concentrations measured with in vivo MRS of 29 pediatric astrocytomas were reviewed. This included 6 patients with astrocytomas (WHO II) who had stable disease (indolent LGA) for >2 years, 7 with aggressive grade II astrocytomas (aggressive LGA), 13 with anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO III), and 3 with glioblastoma (WHO IV) with disease progression within 2 years. Citrate was observed in all patients with aggressive LGA, and the mean citrate concentration was significantly higher in this group than among those with indolent LGA (mean +/- standard deviation, 4.1 +/- 1.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.8 mmol/kg; P < .0001). There was no consistent pattern for citrate in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, with citrate prominent in some lesions whereas undetectable in others. It is unclear whether citrate accumulation occurred because of fundamental defects of citrate regulation or was secondary to altered physiological conditions. Nonetheless, prominent citrate identified a subgroup of pediatric grade II astrocytomas destined for aggressive behavior. Citrate was not specific for poor outcome because it was not detectable in all high-grade astrocytomas. In high-grade astrocytoma, tumors with prominent citrate may constitute a metabolic subclass.

Title: Metabolomics of B to plasma cell differentiation.
Abstract: When small B lymphocytes bind antigen in the context of suitable signals, a profound geno-proteomic metamorphosis is activated that generates antibody-secreting cells. To study the metabolic changes associated with this differentiation program, we compared the exometabolome of differentiating murine B lymphoma cells and primary B cells by monodimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography. Principal component analysis, a multivariate statistical analysis, highlighted metabolic hallmarks of the sequential differentiation phases discriminating between the proliferation and antibody secreting phases and revealing novel metabolic pathways. During proliferation, lactate production increased together with consumption of essential amino acids; massive Ig secretion was paralleled by alanine and glutamate production, glutamine being used as carbon and energy sources. Notably, ethanol and 5'-methylthioadenosine were produced during the last phase of protein secretion and the proliferative burst, respectively. Our metabolomics results are in agreement with previous genoproteomics studies. Thus, metabolic profiling of extracellular medium is a useful tool to characterize the functional state of differentiating B cells and to identify novel underlying metabolic pathways.

Title: Detection of tumor glutamate metabolism in vivo using (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]glutamate.
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization can be used to increase the sensitivity of solution state (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy by four orders of magnitude. We show here that [1-(13)C]glutamate can be polarized to 28%, representing a 35,000-fold increase in its sensitivity to detection at 9.4 T and 37 degrees C. The metabolism of hyperpolarized glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate, catalyzed by the enzyme alanine transaminase, was detected in vitro in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Incubation of the cells with sodium pyruvate increased the level of the hyperpolarized label in the alpha-ketoglutarate pool, with an associated increase in the apparent rate constant describing flux of hyperpolarized (13)C label between glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate. The metabolism of hyperpolarized glutamate was observed in vivo following coadministration of pyruvate in a murine lymphoma model. This represents a new method to probe glutamate metabolism and citric acid cycle activity in vivo; as glutamate is an endogenous molecule, it has the potential to be used in the clinic.

Title: In the assessment of supratentorial glioma grade: the combined role of multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging.
Abstract: AIM: To detect a difference in the parameters derived from proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) between low-grade and high-grade gliomas, and to evaluate whether the combination of these two techniques can improve the diagnostic accuracy of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in supratentorial glioma grading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with histologically proved supratentorial brain gliomas (12 low grade, 18 high grade) were prospectively evaluated with contrast material-enhanced MRI, DTI, and multivoxel (1)H-MRS (135 ms echo time). The tumour grades determined using the three methods were then compared with those obtained at histopathology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine the optimum thresholds for glioma grading. Independent sample t-test, Spearman's rank correlation, and the Fisher's exact test were also carried out for statistical analysis. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between the low-grade and high-grade gliomas for the choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr, NAA/Cho ratio in the tumours (p<0.01), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (p<0.01), and fractional anisotropy (FA) value (p<0.05) in the tumours. The NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios and the calculated ADC value significantly correlated with the histological grading of the gliomas (p<0.01). Using a threshold value of 0.66 for tumour NAA/Cr, 0.265 for NAA/Cho, 1118.1x10(-6) mm(2)/s for the calculated ADC value, corresponding to the maximum Youden index from the ROC curve of the above-selected parameters, the resultant sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and Kappa values were all higher and the fraction of misclassified tumour was lower when compared with conventional MRI. However, only NAA/Cho and ADC calculation contributed to the significant difference (p<0.01) in the assessment of glioma grade compared to conventional MRI alone, and the grading results of statistical tests comparing those two parameters were highly consistent (kappa value=0.798). CONCLUSION: Thresholds for NAA/Cho and calculated ADC values, corresponding to maximum Youden index from ROC curve analyses, helped to improve the accuracy of supratentorial glioma grading when compared with conventional MRI alone. In addition, a combination of NAA/Cho and ADC calculation were more useful together than each alone in a clinical setting to evaluate glioma grade preoperatively and provide a means for guiding treatment.

Title: Facile synthesis [5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)]-L-glutamine for hyperpolarized MRS imaging of cancer cell metabolism.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Recent reports suggest that cancer cells may use glutamine, instead of glucose, as an alternative source of metabolic energy. This suggests that hyperpolarized (13)C glutamine may be useful as a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging agent for detecting changes in glutamine metabolism in cancerous cells or tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesis of [5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)]-L-glutamine was accomplished through a seven-step synthetic pathway with a 44% overall yield. The introduction of two stable isotopes was performed by a NaB(2)H(4)-mixed anhydride reduction and K(13)CN-nuclophilic substitution, respectively. The desired [5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)]-L-glutamine was successfully obtained by a one-pot reaction of deprotection and controlled cyanide hydrolysis. Hyperpolarized [5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)]-L-glutamine samples were tested in human glioma cells (myc upregulated glia cells, SF188-Bcl-x(L)). MRS signals were obtained with a 9.4 Tesla 89-mm bore nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer and a direct-detection multi-nuclear probe. RESULTS: The initial degree of polarization for [5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)]-L-glutamine was ~5% and the initial (13)C signal to noise ratio was ~100:1. Glutamate was detected within seconds after the injection of hyperpolarized glutamine into the cells. The ratio of glutamate to glutamine was very high, indicating rapid conversion to glutamate. Similar cell uptake studies using [(3)H]-L-glutamine also demonstrated cell uptakes higher than that of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose. CONCLUSION: We are reporting the first example of using specifically deuterated [5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)]-L-glutamine in conjunction with hyperpolarized MRS for studying "glutaminolysis" in proliferating tumor cells.

Title: Predicting the outcome of grade II glioma treated with temozolomide using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for monitoring the WHO grade II glioma (low-grade glioma (LGG)) treated with temozolomide (TMZ). METHODS: This prospective study included adult patients with progressive LGG that was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Temozolomide was administered at every 28 days. Response to TMZ was evaluated by monthly MRI examinations that included MRI with volumetric calculations and (1)H-MRS for assessing Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Univariate, multivariate and receiver-operating characteristic statistical analyses were performed on the results. RESULTS: A total of 21 LGGs from 31 patients were included in the study, and followed for at least n=14 months during treatment. A total of 18 (86%) patients experienced a decrease in tumour volume with a greater decrease of metabolic ratios. Subsequently, five (28%) of these tumours resumed growth despite the continuation of TMZ administration with an earlier increase of metabolic ratios of 2 months. Three (14%) patients did not show any volume or metabolic change. The evolutions of the metabolic ratios, mean(Cho/Cr)(n) and mean(Cho/NAA)(n), were significantly correlated over time (Spearman rho=+0.95) and followed a logarithmic regression (P>0.001). The evolutions over time of metabolic ratios, mean(Cho/Cr)(n) and mean(Cho/NAA)(n), were significantly correlated with the evolution of the mean relative decrease of tumour volume, mean(DeltaV(n)/V(o)), according to a linear regression (P<0.001) in the 'response/no relapse' patient group, and with the evolution of the mean tumour volume (meanV(n)), according to an exponential regression (P<0.001) in the 'response/relapse' patient group. The mean relative decrease of metabolic ratio, mean(Delta(Cho/Cr)(n)/(Cho/Cr)(o)), at n=3 months was predictive of tumour response over the 14 months of follow-up. The mean relative change between metabolic ratios, mean((Cho/NAA)(n)-(Cho/Cr)(n))/(Cho/NAA)(n), at n=4 months was predictive of tumour relapse with a significant cutoff of 0.046, a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 100% (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The (1)H-MRS profile changes more widely and rapidly than tumour volume during the response and relapse phases, and represents an early predictive factor of outcome over 14 months of follow-up. Thus, (1)H-MRS may be a promising, non-invasive tool for predicting and monitoring the clinical response to TMZ.

Title: Effects of PBN and OKN007 in rodent glioma models assessed by 1H MR spectroscopy.
Abstract: Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors in adults, have a poor outcome. PBN (alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone) and OKN007 (2,4-disulfophenyl-PBN) are nitrones that have demonstrated beneficial effects in many aging diseases. In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor effects of PBN and OKN007 in several rodent glioma models (C6, RG2, and GL261) by assessing metabolite alterations with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). PBN or OKN007 was administered in drinking water before or after tumor formation. MR imaging and single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy were done to assess tumor morphology and metabolites, after therapy. Major metabolite ratios (choline, N-acetylaspartate, and lipid (methylene or methyl), all compared to creatine), as well as quantification of individual metabolite concentrations, were assessed. Nitrones induced tumor metabolism changes that resulted in restoring major metabolite ratios close to their normal levels, in the glioma regression phase. Nitrone treatment decreased the lipid (methylene)-to-creatine ratio, as well as the estimated concentration of lipid (methylene) significantly. Alterations in lipids can be a useful marker for the evaluation of the efficacy associated with treatment and were found in this study to be related to the reduction of necrosis, but not apoptosis. OKN007 was more effective than PBN when administered after tumor formation in the C6 glioma model. In conclusion, (1)H MRS and conventional MRI are useful methods to assess and follow the response of varied glioma models to anti-tumor treatments.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy predicts survival in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
Abstract: Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) face a grim prognosis with limited treatment options. Many patients will enroll on investigational trials though the role of chemotherapy or immunotherapy is unclear. Radiographic changes on conventional MRI are used to evaluate tumor response and progression, but are not predictive of outcome in these patients. More sensitive measures of tumor biology are needed to improve patient management. We evaluated changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers in patients with DIPG. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled prospectively on an IRB-approved protocol, which included standard MRI, single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and multi-slice multi-voxel spectroscopy (MRSI). Scans were performed at multiple time points during each patient's clinical course, with a total of 142 scans. The prognostic values of Choline:N-acetylaspartate (Cho:NAA), Cho:Creatine (Cho:Cr) and the presence of lactate and lipids (+Lac/Lip) were evaluated. Cho:NAA and variance in Cho:NAA values among different voxels within a tumor were each predictive of shorter survival. This prospective study shows that MRS can be used to identify high-risk patients and monitor changes in tumor metabolism, which may reflect changes in tumor behavior.

Title: [2,4-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate metabolism in astrocytes and C6 glioblastoma cells.
Abstract: This study was undertaken to determine if the ketogenic diet could be useful for glioblastoma patients. The hypothesis tested was whether glioblastoma cells can metabolize ketone bodies. Cerebellar astrocytes and C6 glioblastoma cells were incubated in glutamine and serum free medium containing [2,4-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) with and without glucose. Furthermore, C6 cells were incubated with [1-(13)C]glucose in the presence and absence of BHB. Cell extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry and media by (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC. Using [2,4-(13)C]BHB and [1-(13)C]glucose it could be shown that C6 cells, in analogy to astrocytes, had efficient mitochondrial activity, evidenced by (13)C labeling of glutamate, glutamine and aspartate. However, in the presence of glucose, astrocytes were able to produce and release glutamine, whereas this was not accomplished by the C6 cells, suggesting lack of anaplerosis in the latter. We hypothesize that glioblastoma cells kill neurons by not supplying the necessary glutamine, and by releasing glutamate.

Title: Imaging of primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Abstract: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) comprises 5% of all primary brain tumours. PCNSL demonstrates a variety of well-documented imaging findings, which can vary depending on immune status and histological type. Imaging features of PCNSL may overlap with other tumours and infection making definitive diagnosis challenging. In addition, several rare variants of PCNSL have been described, each with their own imaging characteristics. Advanced imaging techniques including 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)FDG) and (11)C positron-emission tomography (PET), (201)Tl single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and MR perfusion, have been used to aid differentiation of PCNSL from other tumours. Ultimately, no imaging method can definitively diagnose PCNSL, and histology is required.

Title: Serial magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals a direct metabolic effect of cediranib in glioblastoma.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is increasingly used in clinical studies of brain tumor to provide information about tissue metabolic profiles. In this study, we evaluated changes in the levels of metabolites predominant in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM) to characterize the response of rGBM to antiangiogenic therapy. We examined 31 rGBM patients treated with daily doses of cediranib, acquiring serial chemical shift imaging data at specific time points during the treatment regimen. We defined spectra from three regions of interest (ROI)--enhancing tumor (ET), peritumoral tissue, and normal tissue on the contralateral side (cNT)--in post-contrast T1-weighted images, and normalized the concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho) in each ROI to the concentration of creatine in cNT (norCre). We analyzed the ratios of these normalized metabolites (i.e., NAA/Cho, NAA/norCre, and Cho/norCre) by averaging all patients and categorizing two different survival groups. Relative to pretreatment values, NAA/Cho in ET was unchanged through day 28. However, after day 28, NAA/Cho significantly increased in relation to a significant increase in NAA/norCre and a decrease in Cho/norCre; interestingly, the observed trend was reversed after day 56, consistent with the clinical course of GBM recurrence. Notably, receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that NAA/Cho in tumor shows a high prediction to 6-month overall survival. These metabolic changes in these rGBM patients strongly suggest a direct metabolic effect of cediranib and might also reflect an antitumor response to antiangiogenic treatment during the first 2 months of treatment. Further study is needed to confirm these findings.

Title: Choline metabolism, proliferation, and angiogenesis in nonenhancing grades 2 and 3 astrocytoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To study choline metabolism in biopsies from nonenhancing Grade 2 (AS2) and Grade 3 (AS3) astrocytomas to determine whether (1) phosphocholine (PC) dominates in AS3, and (2) PC is associated with proliferation or angiogenesis. PC and glycerophosphocholine (GPC) are involved in phospholipid metabolism that accompanies mitosis. PC is the predominant peak in Grade 4 astrocytoma (GBM) while GPC dominates in AS2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy to compare the concentrations of 10 metabolites in 41 biopsies (16 AS2 and 25 AS3) from 24 tumors. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paired biopsies to determine the cell density, Ki-67 proliferation index, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) angiogenic marker expression. RESULTS: AS3 had higher PC than AS2; however, the PC:GPC was less than 1 in all cases irrespective of tumor grade. Within tumors, GPC increased with Ki-67 and PC and tCho increased with cell density. There was no association between any choline compound and VEGF. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that PC:GPC less than 1 is not unique to low grade glioma. Furthermore, the PC concentration that is a marker of aggressive glial tumors is not tightly linked to cell proliferation or angiogenesis in nonenhancing astrocytomas.

Title: NMR metabolic and physiological markers of therapeutic response.
Abstract: Identification of reliable metabolic and physiological NMR detectable markers for prediction and early detection of therapeutic response is essential to enabling NMR guided individualized therapy for cancer. Because non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a prevalent form of cancer that exhibits~50% response to therapy and often presents with large superficial lesions easily accessible to multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements, it is an ideal test bed for development of NMR methods for prediction and early detection of response.A multicenter study, in which we have participated, has already shown that pre-treatment(31) PMRS measurement of the phosphate monoester (PME)to nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) ratio can identify about 2/3 of the patients who are destined not to exhibit a complete clinical response to a variety of therapeutic agents.Because (31)PMRS is limited to relatively large superficial tumors, we have been exploring (1)HMRS and MRI methods for early detection of therapeutic response. Using xenografts of the most common form of human NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we have detected therapeutic response within one cycle of therapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), rituximab plus CHOP (RCHOP) or radiation (15 Gy) through detection of a decrease in lactic acid (Lac) or total choline (tCho) and an increase of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). We have also performed (1)H MRS of NHL patients in a clinical scanner. One of the patients exhibited a 70% decrease in Lac within 48 h of treatment with RCHOP.

Title: Strengths and weaknesses of 1.5T and 3T MRS data in brain glioma classification.
Abstract: Although magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods of 1.5Tesla (T) and 3T have been widely applied during the last decade for noninvasive diagnostic purposes, only a few studies have been reported on the value of the information extracted in brain cancer discrimination. The purpose of this study is threefold. First, to show that the diagnostic value of the information extracted from two different MRS scanners of 1.5T and 3T is significantly influenced in terms of brain gliomas discrimination. Second, to statistically evaluate the discriminative potential of publicly known metabolic ratio markers, obtained from these two types of scanners in classifying low-, intermediate-, and high-grade gliomas. Finally, to examine the diagnostic value of new metabolic ratios in the discrimination of complex glioma cases where the diagnosis is both challenging and critical. Our analysis has shown that although the information extracted from 3T MRS scanner is expected to provide better brain gliomas discrimination; some factors like the features selected, the pulse-sequence parameters, and the spectroscopic data acquisition methods can influence the discrimination efficiency. Finally, it is shown that apart from the bibliographical known, new metabolic ratio features such as N-acetyl aspartate/ S, Choline/ S, Creatine/ S , and myo-Inositol/ S play significant role in gliomas grade discrimination.

Title: Prognostic factors for patients with gliomatosis cerebri: retrospective analysis of 17 consecutive cases.
Abstract: Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a rare fatal glial neoplasm of the central nervous system. Neuroimaging, histological, and clinical outcome data were reviewed of 17 consecutive patients, 8 males and 9 females aged 15-68 years (median, 37 years), treated for GC between April 1992 and October 2007. All patients received cranial irradiation to include the hyperintense area on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The total dose of the radiotherapy was 50-72 Gy (median, 60). Intravenous nimustine hydrochloride was administered in all patients, combined with temozolomide in four patients. The median survival time was 23.3 months, with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the overall survival rate which was 70.6% for 1 year, 23.5% for 3 years, and 17.7% for 5 years. Spinal enhanced lesions and nodular malignant transformation to glioblastoma were observed during follow-up in two patients each. Poor survival showed correlation with higher Ki-67 labeling index, higher choline/N-acetylaspartate ratio on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, tumor volumes, lower Karnofsky performance status on admission, cognitive/behavioral deterioration, poor response to the initial radiochemotherapy, and emergence of paraventricular enhanced lesions during the clinical course. The prognosis for patients with GC is unfavorable, but radiochemotherapy may prolong survival.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the diagnostic evaluation of brainstem lesions in Alexander disease.
Abstract: Alexander disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which can present with brainstem lesions with imaging characteristics similar to multifocal low-grade glioma, thus presenting a diagnostic dilemma. The authors report a 6-year-old child presenting with multifocal brainstem lesions subsequently diagnosed to have Alexander disease. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy generated a metabolite profile of the lesion allowing differentiation from low-grade glioma. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a powerful tool in the assessment of brainstem lesions and is a useful adjunct to conventional magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment and diagnosis of atypical brain lesions.

Title: 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of glioblastoma cancer stem cells.
Abstract: The noninvasive tracking of glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vivo constitutes a prerequisite for the development of CSC-specific therapies. Therefore, as a pilot study to identify CSC biomarkers for clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 10 CSC lines were investigated using high-resolution (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy at 600 and 800 MHz (14.4 and 18.8 T) under reproducible in vitro conditions. The spectra were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), and spectral regions of high variability were evaluated regarding correlations to stem cell-related properties (clonogenic index and CD133 positivity) and cell death. PCA revealed that duplicates of CSC lines clustered together suggesting a characteristic (1)H-NMR pattern of each CSC line. PCA enabled discrimination between samples with high and low clonogenicity, that is, clustering according to one of the hallmarks of stemness in samples with high viability. High/moderate correlations to clonogenicity and CD133 were found in spectral regions with high variability. In contrast, the mobile lipid signal at 1.28 ppm correlated to cell death, but not to stemness, as published previously for neural progenitor cells. In conclusion, our exploratory study demonstrates the correlation of specific resonances within (1)H-NMR spectra with stem cell properties and advocates the use of the 1.28 ppm resonance as biomarker for cell death also in CSCs.

Title: Diffusion tensor images and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in primary central nervous system T-cell lymphoma: a case report.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is rare and usually B cell in origin. T-cell lymphoma constitutes only 1.8% to 4.6% of the PCNSL, and may present as solitary or multiple homogeneous enhanced lesions. There have been few reports showing unusual leukoencephalopathy in PCNSL, which may be confused with other white matter diseases including multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. CASE REPORT: We reported a patient with T-cell PCNSL who presented a progressive dull response and extrapyramidal symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple focal leukoencephalopathy. Diffusion weighted imaging demonstrated hyper-intensity lesions and apparent diffusion coefficient images showed hypo-intensity lesions. Diffuse tensor images showed decreased fractional anisotropy. Pathology examination finally confirmed T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Although recent development of neuro-imaging studies, the diagnosis of PCNSL still await further pathological confirmation in some occasions.

Title: [Clinical experience of stereotactic biopsy for the brain lesions].
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the methodology of diversified advanced image-guided stereotactic biopsy for the brain lesions, and its diagnostic significance and experience in nervous system diseases. METHODS: Retrospectively reviewed 1187 cases of brain lesions underwent image-guided stereotactic biopsy from December 1987 to January 2009. There were 694 male (58.5%) and 493 female (41.5%) patients, aged from 1 to 85 years (average 39.7 years). There were 607 cases in CT-guided, including positron emission computed tomography (PET) guided stereotactic biopsy; 580 cases in MRI-guided, including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) guided stereotactic biopsy. Routine frame was used in 726 cases and frameless stereotactic biopsy in 461 cases, including neuroendoscopic biopsy in 28 cases, guided by computer assisted surgery (CAS) computer-assistant robot. In the early 450 cases, CT/MRI images films were employed to measure the coordinates of the target by hand, while in the late 737 cases, computer-assistant planning software rebuilt the CT/MRI images and figured out the optimal neurosurgical path for biopsy. RESULTS: The positive diagnosis rate of biopsy was 97.4%, 983 (82.8%) cases were diagnosed pathologically as brain tumors, and 173 (14.6%) cases as non-tumor diseases. The tumors mainly including neuroglioma, metastatic tumor, primary central nervous system lymphoma and germ cell tumors. In non-tumor diseases, mainly including multiple sclerosis, tumefactive demyelinating lesion, neurodegenerative disease, inflammation and parasite. The biopsy operation caused small hematoma without neurological deficits in 20 cases (1.7%), and caused large hematoma (> 10 ml) which need neurosurgical treatment (catheterization or craniotomy evacuation of hematoma) in 9 cases (0.8%). Hemorrhage associated with biopsy caused 3 cases (0.3%) death. There were no severe intracranial infection cases. CONCLUSIONS: The stereotactic biopsy with advanced image-guided technique represents a safe, reliable and minimally invasive method for pathological diagnosis of intracranial lesions. Moreover, the developments of biochemical imaging gives a new concept to the stereotactic biopsy.

Title: Detection of tumor response to a vascular disrupting agent by hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Nuclear spin hyperpolarization can dramatically increase the sensitivity of the (13)C magnetic resonance experiment, allowing dynamic measurements of the metabolism of hyperpolarized (13)C-labeled substrates in vivo. Here, we report a preclinical study of the response of lymphoma tumors to the vascular disrupting agent (VDA), combretastatin-A4-phosphate (CA4P), as detected by measuring changes in tumor metabolism of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate and [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate. These measurements were compared with dynamic contrast agent-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) measurements of tumor vascular function and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) measurements of the tumor cell necrosis that resulted from subsequent loss of tumor perfusion. The rate constant describing flux of hyperpolarized (13)C label between [1-(13)C]pyruvate and lactate was decreased by 34% within 6 hours of CA4P treatment and remained at this lower level at 24 hours. The rate constant describing production of labeled malate from hyperpolarized [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate increased 1.6-fold and 2.5-fold at 6 and 24 hours after treatment, respectively, and correlated with the degree of necrosis detected in histologic sections. Although DCE-MRI measurements showed a substantial reduction in perfusion at 6 hours after treatment, which had recovered by 24 hours, DW-MRI showed no change in the apparent diffusion coefficient of tumor water at 6 hours after treatment, although there was a 32% increase at 24 hours (P < 0.02) when regions of extensive necrosis were observed by histology. Measurements of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate and [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate metabolism may provide, therefore, a more sustained and sensitive indicator of response to a VDA than DCE-MRI or DW-MRI, respectively.

Title: Comparison of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography for assessment of brain tumor progression.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We investigated the accuracy of high-field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H MRS) and fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18) F-FDG-PET) for diagnosis of glioma progression following tumor resection, stereotactic radiation, and chemotherapy. METHODS: Twelve post-therapy patients with histology proven gliomas (six grade II and six grade III) presented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical symptoms suggestive but not conclusive of progression were entered into the study. (1) H MRS data were acquired and 3-dimensional volumetric maps of choline (Cho) over creatine (Cr) were generated. Intensity of (18) F-FDG uptake was evaluated on a semiquantitative scale. RESULTS: The accuracy of (1) H MRS and (18) F-FDG-PET imaging for diagnosis of glioma progression was 75% and 83%, respectively. Classifying the tumors by grade improved accuracy of (18) F-FDG-PET to 100% in high-grade gliomas and accuracy of (1) H MRS to 80% in low-grade tumors. Spearman's analysis demonstrated a trend between (18) F-FDG uptake and tumor grading (rho= .612, P-value = .272). The results of (18) F-FDG-PET and (1) H MRS were concordant in 75% (9/12) of cases. CONCLUSION: The combination of (1) H MRS data and (18) F-FDG-PET imaging can enhance detection of glioma progression. (1) H MRS imaging was more accurate in low-grade gliomas and (18) F-FDG-PET provided better accuracy in high-grade gliomas.

Title: (1)H-MRS of intracranial meningiomas: what it can add to known clinical and MRI predictors of the histopathological and biological characteristics of the tumor?
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The main goal of the present study was evaluation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in diagnosis of histopathologically aggressive intracranial meningiomas. METHODS: Single-voxel (1)H-MRS of 100 intracranial meningiomas was performed before their surgical resection. Investigated metabolites included mobile lipids, lactate, alanine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and choline-containing compounds (Cho). According to criteria of World Health Organization (WHO) 82 meningiomas were assigned histopathological grade I, 11 grade II, and 7 grade III. The MIB-1 index varied from 0% to 27.3% (median, 1.6%). In 43 cases tight adhesion of the tumor to the pia mater or brain tissue was macroscopically identified at surgery. The consistency of 49 meningiomas was characterized as soft, 26 as hard, and 25 as mixed. RESULTS: No one metabolic parameter had statistically significant association with histopathological grade and subtype, invasive growth, and consistency of meningioma. Univariate statistical analysis revealed greater (1)H-MRS-detected Cho content (P=0.0444) and lower normalized NAA/Cho ratio (P=0.0203) in tumors with MIB-1 index 5% and more. However, both parameters lost their statistical significance during evaluation in the multivariate model along with other clinical and radiological variables. It was revealed that non-benign histopathology of meningioma (WHO grade II/III) is mainly predicted by irregular shape (P=0.0076) and large size (P=0.0316), increased proliferative activity by irregular shape (P=0.0056), and macroscopically invasive growth by prominent peritumoral edema (P=0.0021). CONCLUSION: While (1)H-MRS may be potentially used for the identification of meningiomas with high proliferative activity, it, seemingly, could not add substantial diagnostic information to other radiological predictors of malignancy in these tumors.

Title: Imaging in primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Abstract: Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) accounts for approximately 3% of all primary CNS tumors. Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency is the only established risk factor for PCNSL. Rates decreased slightly in the mid-1990s, concordantly with the decreasing rates of AIDS. However, the incidence has been increasing in the elderly immunocompetent population, and this trend seems to be independent of improvements in diagnostic techniques, and of overall trends in the incidence of brain tumors and systemic lymphomas. This study presents our experience with the imaging features of PCNSL. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were reviewed in a series of 38 cases of pathologically proven PCNSL. The incidence rate of PCNSL was higher in men than in women (58% versus 42%). Mean age at presentation was 63 years; 120 lesions were demonstrated in the 38 patients, with a 53% frequency of tumor multiplicity. Both CT and MR mainly showed solitary or multiple well-defined round or oval-shaped mass lesions, typically hyperdense on unenhanced CT scans, iso to hypointense on T2 MR weighted images. These lesions also showed an increased signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images. Virtually all lesions enhanced after intravenous administration of contrastmedium. On (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) most lesions presented increased Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and lactate/Cr ratios when compared to normal gray matter. No changes in the imaging presentation have occurred over the past two decades, apart from lesions now being smaller at diagnosis. Our imaging findings are in agreement with the existing literature data and with the reported increasing trend of multifocal tumors. Our epidemiologic results add value to the existing evidence of increasing incidence rates among the immunocompetent elderly population.

Title: Value of 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy chemical shift imaging for detection of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with non-significant contrast-enhancement.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In diffusely infiltrating gliomas (DIG), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a powerful method for detection of anaplastic foci. Recently, (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy chemical shift imaging (CSI) using choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) or choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) ratios has emerged as a new non-invasive, widely available alternative. The authors therefore correlated CSI with (11)C-methionine (MET)-PET data in a series of DIG with non-significant contrast-enhancement (CE). METHODS: Thirty-two patients with DIG were examined with single-slice CSI on a T MRI and MET-PET. Maximum pathological intratumoural ratios of CSI (=CSI(max)) and maximum tumour-to-normal-brain PET ratios (=PET(max); T/N ratio) were determined. Coregistration of MRI with CSI and PET was performed, and the topographic overlap of CSI(max) and PET(max) was analysed. Histological criteria of anaplasia as well as cell proliferation rate were assessed in tumour samples inside and outside CSI(max). RESULTS: CSI showed a pathological ratio in all patients, whereas PET demonstrated a pathological T/N ratio in 21/32 patients. Topographical correlation of CSI(max) and PET(max) revealed a >/= 50% overlap in 18/21 and <50% overlap in 3/21 patients, respectively. Cho/Cr(max) and Cho/NAA(max) showed a >/= 50% overlap in 24/32 and a <50% overlap in 8/32 patients. Cell proliferation rate was significantly higher inside than outside the CSI(max) (13.6% vs 6.9%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that CSI is a promising method for detection of anaplastic foci within DIG with non-significant CE. Intraoperative use of CSI by multimodal neuronavigation may increase the reliability of detection of malignant areas in glioma surgery and therefore optimise allocation of patients to adjuvant treatments.

Title: [Clinical factors in glioblastoma and neuroradiology].
Abstract: Glioblastoma is found preferentially in men (1.5/1), nearing age 60, but all ages can be concerned. Clinical symptoms are intracranial mass without specificity, intracranial hypertension and localization signs. From the clinical history, the essential prognosis factors are: age, Karnofsky score and cognitive dysfunction. Conventional MRI sequences, including T1-FSE with and without contrast injection and T2-FSE or Flair-weighted sequences, provide the diagnosis in most cases, showing an intraparenchymal mass with a heterogeneous, irregularly enhanced signal. Other sequences define the tumor more precisely. Diffusion sequences provide the differential diagnosis with an abscess or a highly cellular tumor such as lymphoma. Perfusion sequences allow appreciation of tumor microvascularization outlining the tumor's most active areas. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SRM) sequences allow noninvasive exploration of tumor metabolism. Beyond its diagnostic role, imagery assists the surgical procedure itself, particularly with functional MRI, allowing a precise preoperative mapping of functional cortical areas. Biopsy can also be guided toward the most active areas of the tumor. In the postoperative period, MRI completes the surgeon's impression on whether or not there is residual tumor. Finally, this exam has become essential in follow-up to diagnose recurrence, radionecrosis, or pseudoprogression.

Title: Brain F-18 Fluorocholine PET/CT for the assessment of optic pathway glioma in neurofibromatosis-1.
Abstract: A 22-year-old man diagnosed with neurofibromatosis-I was admitted to the neurology department because of progressive hemianopsia and chronic headache. Magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and F-18 fluorocholine revealed a splenial mass with imaging features compatible with malignant astrocytoma. At follow-up examination, the sharp decrease in F-18 fluorocholine uptake and in choline/creatine ratio supported a conservative management. Molecular imaging of optic pathway gliomas may be a valuable tool in the selection of therapeutic options.

Title: Advanced MRI and PET imaging for assessment of treatment response in patients with gliomas.
Abstract: Imaging techniques are important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up of patients with gliomas. T1-weighted MRI, with or without gadolinium, is the gold standard method. However, this technique only reflects biological activity of the tumour indirectly by detecting the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, especially for low-grade glioma or after treatment, T1-weighted MRI enhanced with gadolinium has substantial limitations. Development of more advanced imaging methods to improve outcomes for individual patients is needed. New imaging methods based on MRI and PET can be employed in various stages of disease to target the biological activity of the tumour cells (eg, increased uptake of aminoacids or nucleoside analogues), the changes in diffusivity through the interstitial space (diffusion-weighted MRI), the tumour-induced neovascularisation (perfusion-weighted MRI or contrast-enhanced MRI, or increased uptake of aminoacids in endothelial wall), and the changes in concentrations of metabolites (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). These techniques have advantages and disadvantages, and should be used in conjunction to best help individual patients. Advanced imaging techniques need to be validated in clinical trials to ensure standardisation and evidence-based implementation in routine clinical practice.

Title: Early detection of radiation therapy response in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma xenografts by in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging.
Abstract: The purpose of the study was to investigate the capability of (1)H MRS and MRI methods for detecting early response to radiation therapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Studies were performed on the WSU-DLCL2 xenograft model in nude mice of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of NHL. Radiation treatment was applied as a single 15 Gy dose to the tumor. Tumor lactate, lipids, total choline, T(2) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured before treatment and at 24 h and 72 h after radiation. A Hadamard-encoded slice-selective multiple quantum coherence spectroscopy sequence was used for detecting lactate (Lac) while a stimulated echo acquisition mode sequence was used for detection of total choline (tCho) and lipids. T(2)- and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences were used for measuring T(2) and ADC. Within 24 h after radiation, significant changes were observed in the normalized integrated resonance intensities of Lac and the methylenes of lipids. Lac/H(2)O decreased by 38 +/- 15% (p = 0.03), and lipid (1.3 ppm, CH(2))/H(2)O increased by 57 +/- 14% (p = 0.01). At 72 h after radiation, tCho/H(2)O decreased by 45 +/- 14% (p = 0.01), and lipid (2.8 ppm, polyunsaturated fatty acid)/H(2)O increased by 970 +/- 36% (p = 0.001). ADC increased by 14 +/- 2% (p = 0.003), and T(2) did not change significantly. Tumor growth delay and regression were observed thereafter. This study enabled comparison of the relative sensitivities of various (1)H MRS and MRI indices to radiation and suggests that (1)H MRS/MRI measurements detect early responses to radiation that precede tumor volume changes.

Title: 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites as biomarkers for cell cycle arrest and cell death in rat glioma cells.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Improved non-invasive imaging biomarkers of treatment response contribute to optimising cancer management and metabolites detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) show promise in this area. Understanding (1)H MRS changes occurring in cells during cell stress and cell death in vitro should aid the selection of pertinent biomarkers for clinical use. METHODS: BT4C glioma cells in culture were exposed to either 50 muM cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum II (cisplatin) or starvation by culture in phosphate buffered saline. High resolution magic angle spinning (1)H MRS was performed on cells using a Varian 600 MHz nanoprobe and metabolites were quantified by a time domain fitting method. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue, H&E, 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), DNA laddering and annexin V-FITC labelled flow cytometry; propidium iodide flow cytometry was used to assess the cell cycle phase. RESULTS: With cisplatin exposure, cells initially accumulated in the G1 stage of the cell cycle with low numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells and this was associated with decreases in phosphocholine, succinate, alanine, taurine, glycine and glutamate and increases in lactate and glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Starvation, leading to necrotic cell death within 6-18 h, caused decreases in succinate, alanine, glycine, and glutamate and increases in GPC. Principal component analysis revealed two patterns of metabolite changes, one common to both types of cell stress and another specific for necrosis secondary to cell starvation. CONCLUSIONS: (1)H MRS reveals alterations in multiple metabolites during cell cycle arrest and cell death which may provide early biomarker profiles of treatment efficacy in vivo.

Title: Hyperpolarized alpha-keto[1-(13)C]isocaproate as a (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopic agent for profiling branched chain amino acid metabolism in tumors.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a technique that allows us to non-invasively detect multiple small metabolites within cells or extracellular spaces in vivo (1, 2). The clinical use of MRS as an adjunct to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly in cancer detection and treatment response evaluation, has expanded dramatically over the past several years. Although MRS is theoretically applicable to any nucleus possessing spin, the most important and more frequently investigated applications are in proton ((1)H) and carbon-13 ((13)C) (1, 3, 4). (13)C MRS is superior to (1)H MRS in many respects (5-7). (13)C MRS can provide specific information about the identity and structure of biologically important compounds. The chemical shift range for carbon (~250 ppm) is much larger than that for proton (~15 ppm), allowing for improved resolution of metabolites. In addition, the T(1) relaxation time of (13)C in small molecules is much longer than that of (1)H (0.1-2.0 s in a magnetic field of 0.1-3.0 T), allowing the generation of hyperpolarized (13)C-labeled tracers outside the subject and the MRI scanner. Some of these tracers are endogenous and therefore have lower toxicity than drugs and exogenous contrast media (2). However, (13)C MRS is limited by the low natural abundance of (13)C (1.1%) and its low magnetogyric ratio (gamma of (13)C is one quarter that of (1)H) (1, 6). Several techniques have been used to overcome the (13)C MRS limitation through enhancing the polarization of nuclear spins. One technique is proton decoupling, which eliminates the coupling of (1)H with (13)C by irradiating the entire (1)H resonance absorption range and consequently collapsing (13)C resonances to singlets (8, 9). The signal/noise ratio of (13)C resonances has been shown to be significantly increased with proton decoupling. Another technique is known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which introduces one or more (13)C molecules into a metabolic substrate (3, 10, 11). DNP transfers high electron spin polarization to nuclear spins via microwave irradiation. Nearly 100% nuclear polarization for (1)H and 50% for (13)C can be achieved in various organic molecules when DNP is performed in a strong magnetic field and at cryogenic temperatures. Hyperpolarization of protons ex vivo is less interesting for medical applications, because most of the hyperpolarization would have vanished before the molecule reaches the target organ. However, the T(1) of (13)C in small molecules, in general, is much longer than the T(1) of protons. A large number of low molecular weight substances with (13)C T(1) in excess of 10 s are available. Replacing the (12)C isotope (98.9% natural abundance) with the (13)C isotope at a specific carbon or carbons in a metabolic substrate does not affect the substrate's biochemistry. With (13)C MRS, the body tissues are virtually invisible, and only regions where the hyperpolarized (13)C-labeled substance is present will appear in the generated images. Thus, (13)C-labeled substrates can provide >10,000-fold enhancement of the (13)C MRS signals from the substrate and its subsequent metabolic products, allowing the assessment of changes in metabolic fluxes in vivo through glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and fatty acid synthesis (2, 11, 12). Vascular and perfusion imaging can also be performed without background signal from surrounding tissues (6, 13). Karlsson et al. generated a hyperpolarized small molecule, alpha-keto[1-(13)C]isocaproate ([1-(13)C]KIC) as a (13)C MRS agent for imaging the molecular signature of branched chain amino acid metabolism, which is regulated by the branched chain amino acid transferase (BCAT) (5). There are two isoforms, BCAT1 and BCAT2, that code for mitochondrial and cytosolic BCAT, respectively (5, 14). BCAT is highly expressed in early embryogenesis, and it is also a target for MYC activity during oncogenesis. BCAT has been shown to be a useful marker for grading and genetic characterization of tumors. KIC is a substrate of BCAT and is metabolized to leucine in vivo. Karlsson et al. demonstrated that metabolism of the hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]KIC yielded unprecedented MRI contrast between EL4 murine lymphoma and surrounding healthy tissue, but yielded no contrast between R3230AC rat mammary adenocarcinoma and its surrounding tissue. The [1-(13)C]leucine signal detected in the two tumor models correlated well with ex vivo measurements of the BCAT activity in the two tumor tissues. The investigators concluded that the understanding of metabolic differences between tumors could be advanced with use of the hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]KIC biomarker in assessing tissue BCAT activity in vivo by means of the [1-(13)C]leucine signal (5).

Title: Structural basis for the recognition of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase oncoprotein by the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target-2.
Abstract: The nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) fusion oncoprotein, formed by the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and interacts with a number of signaling molecules. One of the interacting partners of NPM-ALK is the adaptor protein, Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target (SNT), and mutations that deprive NPM-ALK of all three of the SNT-binding sites significantly reduced the transforming activity. In this study, the interactions of the three binding sites in NPM-ALK with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of SNT-2 were analyzed. First, by isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that the phosphorylation-independent binding site in NPM-ALK interacts with the SNT-2 PTB domain more tightly than the phosphorylation-dependent binding sites. Second, the solution structure of the SNT-2 PTB domain in complex with the nonphosphorylated NPM-ALK peptide was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The NPM-ALK peptide interacts with the hydrophobic surface of the PTB domain and intermolecularly extends the PTB beta-sheet. This interaction mode is much broader and more extensive than those of the phosphorylation-dependent binding sites. Our results indicate that the higher binding activity of the phosphorylation-independent binding site is caused by additional hydrophobic interactions.

Title: In vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a human brain tumor after application of 13C-1-enriched glucose.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: As a unique tool to assess metabolic fluxes noninvasively, (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) could help to characterize and understand malignancy in human tumors. However, its low sensitivity has hampered applications in patients. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that with sensitivity-optimized localized (13)C MRS and intravenous infusion of [1-(13)C]glucose under euglycemia, it is possible to assess the dynamic conversion of glucose into its metabolic products in vivo in human glioma tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements were done at 3 T with a broadband single RF channel and a quadrature (13)C surface coil inserted in a (1)H volume coil. A (1)H/(13)C polarization transfer sequence was applied, modified for localized acquisition, alternatively in two (50 ml) voxels, one encompassing the tumor and the other normal brain tissue. RESULTS: After about 20 min of [1-(13)C]glucose infusion, a [3-(13)C]lactate signal appeared among several resonances of metabolic products of glucose in MR spectra of the tumor voxel. The resonance of [3-(13)C]lactate was absent in MR spectra from contralateral tissue. In addition, the intensity of [1-(13)C]glucose signals in the tumor area was about 50% higher than that in normal tissue, likely reflecting more glucose in extracellular space due to a defective blood-brain barrier. The signal intensity for metabolites produced in or via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was lower in the tumor than in the contralateral area, albeit that the ratios of isotopomer signals were comparable. CONCLUSION: With an improved (13)C MRS approach, the uptake of glucose and its conversion into metabolites such as lactate can be monitored noninvasively in vivo in human brain tumors. This opens the way to assessing metabolic activity in human tumor tissue.

Title: Hyperpolarized [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate as an imaging agent of tumor cell death in vivo.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a technique that allows us to non-invasively detect multiple small metabolites within cells or extracellular spaces in vivo (1-3). The clinical use of MRS as an adjunct to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly in cancer detection and treatment response evaluation, has expanded dramatically over the past several years. Although MRS is theoretically applicable to any nucleus possessing spin, the most important and more frequently investigated applications are in proton ((1)H) and carbon-13 ((13)C) (4-6). (13)C MRS is superior to (1)H MRS in many respects (3, 6-8). (13)C MRS can provide specific information about the identity and structure of biologically important compounds. The chemical shift range for carbon (~250 ppm) is much larger than that for proton (~15 ppm), allowing for improved resolution of metabolites. In addition, the T(1) relaxation time of (13)C in small molecules is much longer than that of (1)H (0.1-2.0 s in a magnetic field of 0.1-3.0 T), allowing the generation of hyperpolarized (13)C-labeled tracers outside the subject and the MRI scanner. Some of these tracers are endogenous and therefore have lower toxicity than drugs and exogenous contrast media (6). However, (13)C MRS is limited by the low natural abundance of (13)C (1.1%) and its low magnetogyric ratio (gamma of (13)C is one quarter that of (1)H) (2, 3). Several techniques have been used to overcome the (13)C MRS limitation through enhancing the polarization of nuclear spins. One technique is proton decoupling, which eliminates the coupling of (1)H with (13)C by irradiating the entire (1)H resonance absorption range and consequently collapsing (13)C resonances to singlets (4, 5). The signal/noise ratio of (13)C resonances has been shown to be significantly increased with proton decoupling. Another technique is known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which introduces one or more (13)C molecules into a metabolic substrate (2, 3, 8). DNP transfers high electron spin polarization to nuclear spins via microwave irradiation. Nearly 100% nuclear polarization for (1)H and 50% for (13)C can be achieved in various organic molecules when DNP is performed in a strong magnetic field and at cryogenic temperatures. Replacing the (12)C (98.9% natural abundance) isotope with the (13)C isotope at a specific carbon or carbons in a metabolic substrate does not affect the substrate's biochemistry. With (13)C MRS, the body tissues are virtually invisible, and only regions where the hyperpolarized (13)C-labeled substance is present will appear in the generated images. Thus, (13)C-labeled substrates can provide >10,000-fold enhancement of the (13)C MRS signals from the substrate and its subsequent metabolic products, allowing the assessment of changes in metabolic fluxes in vivo through glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and fatty acid synthesis (1, 9-13). Vascular and perfusion imaging can also be performed without background signal from surrounding tissues (3, 14). Gallagher et al. generated a hyperpolarized small molecule, [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate, as an imaging agent of (13)C MRS for evaluation of early tumor response to treatment and other pathological states in which cell death plays a role, such as toxic insults or ischemia (1). Fumarate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, is hydrated to produce malate in a reaction catalyzed by fumarase (or fumarate hydratase). The transport of fumarate across the plasma membrane is mediated by the sodium-dependent dicarboxylate acid transporter, which also transports succinate. Fumarate transport across the mitochondrial membrane occurs in exchange for malate, inorganic phosphate, or aspartate. The reaction enzyme fumarase exists as both cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms, and the relative activity of the two isoforms varies markedly between tissues and between species. The investigators showed that [1,4-(13)C(2)]malate production from [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate is increased in treated lymphoma cells and tumors, and that this increase is caused by tumor cell necrosis. The formation of hyperpolarized [1,4-(13)C(2)]malate from [1,4-(13)C(2)]fumarate appears to be a sensitive marker of tumor cell death in vivo and could be used to detect the early response of tumors to treatment (1).

Title: Lipid metabolism impairment in human gliomas: expression of peroxisomal proteins in human gliomas at different grades of malignancy.
Abstract: Gliomas are histologically graded by cellularity, cytological atypia, necrosis, mitotic figures, and vascular proliferation, features associated with biologically aggressive behaviour. However, abundant evidence suggests the presence of unrecognized, clinically relevant subclasses of the diffuse gliomas, both in respect to their underlying molecular phenotype and their clinical response to therapy. It is well-known that patient prognosis and therapeutic decisions rely on accurate pathological grading. Recently, it was reported that human gliomas accumulate lipid droplets during progression, suggesting a lipid metabolism impairment. Considering the crucial role of peroxisomes in lipid metabolism, in the present work we studied the expression profiles of proteins either exclusively localized to peroxisomes, such as peroxin14 (PEX14), peroxisomal membrane protein 70Kda (PMP70), acyl-CoA oxidase, thiolase, or partially associated to peroxisomes such as Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoA-red) and peroxisomal-related proteins, namely PPARalpha, in human glioma specimens at different grades of malignancy. Moreover, Nile red staining of lipid droplets, thin layer chromatography (TLC) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) were carried out in order to correlate the biochemical results with the lipid content of tumor tissues. The results obtained indicate that correlating the malignancy grade with the expression of peroxisomal genes and proteins, may constitute a sensitive tool to highlight possible subtypes not recognized by the classical histological techniques.

Title: Cellular and in vivo activity of a novel PI3K inhibitor, PX-866, against human glioblastoma.
Abstract: The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt oncogenic pathway is critical in glioblastomas. Loss of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway or activated PI3K/Akt pathway that drive increased proliferation, survival, neovascularization, glycolysis, and invasion is found in 70%-80% of malignant gliomas. Thus, PI3K is an attractive therapeutic target for malignant glioma. We report that a new irreversible PI3K inhibitor, PX-866, shows potent inhibitory effects on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in glioblastoma. PX-866 did not induce any apoptosis in glioma cells; however, an increase in autophagy was observed. PX-866 inhibited the invasive and angiogenic capabilities of cultured glioblastoma cells. In vivo, PX-866 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and increased the median survival time of animals with intracranial tumors. We also assessed the potential of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a noninvasive method to monitor response to PX-866. Our findings show that PX-866 treatment causes a drop in the MRS-detectable choline-to-NAA, ratio and identify this partial normalization of the tumor metabolic profile as a biomarker of molecular drug action. Our studies affirm that the PI3K pathway is a highly specific molecular target for therapies for glioblastoma and other cancers with aberrant PI3K/PTEN expression.

Title: Noninvasive detection of target modulation following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition using hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Numerous mechanism-based anticancer drugs that target the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are in clinical trials. However, it remains challenging to assess responses by traditional imaging methods. Here, we show for the first time the efficacy of hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in detecting the effect of PI3K inhibition by monitoring hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]lactate levels produced from hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. In GS-2 glioblastoma cells, PI3K inhibition by LY294002 or everolimus caused hyperpolarized lactate to drop to 42 +/- 12% and to 76 +/- 5%, respectively. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, hyperpolarized lactate dropped to 71 +/- 15% after treatment with LY294002. These reductions were correlated with reductions in LDH activity to 48 +/- 4%, 63 +/- 4%, and 69 +/- 12%, respectively, and were associated with a drop in levels of LDHA mRNA and LDHA and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha proteins. Supporting these findings, tumor growth inhibition achieved by everolimus in murine GS-2 xenografts was associated with a drop in the hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio detected by in vivo MRS imaging, whereas an increase in this ratio occurred with tumor growth in control animals. Taken together, our findings illustrate the application of hyperpolarized (13)C MRS of pyruvate to monitor alterations in LDHA activity and expression caused by PI3K pathway inhibition, showing the potential of this method for noninvasive imaging of drug target modulation.

Title: Correlations between in vivo (1)H MRS and ex vivo (1)H HRMAS metabolite measurements in adult human gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess how accurately ex vivo high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) from small biopsy tissues relate to in vivo (1)H MRS (from larger tumor volumes) in human astrocytomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo (PRESS, TE = 30 msec) and ex vivo (presaturation) (1)H spectra of 17 human astrocytomas (4 grade II, 1 grade III and 12 glioblastomas) were quantified using LCModel. Concentrations of 11 metabolites and 2 lipid/macromolecules were retrospectively compared, with histogram analysis of the in vivo MRI data used to evaluate tumor heterogeneity. RESULTS: For homogeneous-appearing tumors, significant correlations were found between in vivo and ex vivo (1)H MRS concentrations of those metabolites known to be metabolically stable in postmortem tissues (eg, creatine, myo-inositol, total cholines, and the approximately 1.3 and 0.9 ppm lipids). Anaerobic glycolysis during biopsy surgical removal depletes the tissue of glucose, increasing alanine and lactate, and resulted in no correlation between these in vivo and ex vivo metabolite concentrations. CONCLUSION: Within defined limitations, ex vivo astrocytoma biopsy HRMAS (1)H spectra have similar metabolic profiles to that obtained in vivo and therefore detailed ex vivo characterization of glioma biopsies can directly relate to the original tumor.

Title: Using ex vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to reveal associations between biochemical and biological features of meningiomas.
Abstract: OBJECT: The goal in this study was to determine if proton ((1)H) MR spectroscopy can differentiate meningioma grade and is associated with interpretations of biological behavior; the study was performed using ex vivo high-resolution spectra indicating metabolic characteristics. METHODS: Sixty-eight resected tissue samples of meningiomas were examined using ex vivo (1)H MR spectroscopy. Of these meningiomas, 46 were WHO Grade I, 14 were WHO Grade II, and 8 were WHO Grade III. Fifty-nine were primary meningiomas and 9 were recurrences. Invasion of adjacent tissue (dura mater, bone, venous sinus, brain) was found in 32 cases. Thirty-nine meningiomas did not rapidly recur (as defined by expansion on MR imaging within a 5-year follow-up period), whereas rapid recurrence was confirmed in 24 meningiomas, and follow-up status was unknown in 5 cases. RESULTS: The absolute concentrations of total alanine and creatine were decreased in high-grade compared with low-grade meningiomas, as was the ratio of glycine to alanine (all p < 0.05). Additionally, alanine and the glycine/alanine ratio distinguished between primary and recurrent meningiomas (all p < 0.05). Finally, the absolute concentrations of alanine and creatine, and the glycine/alanine and choline/glutamate ratios were associated with rapid recurrence (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that meningioma tissue can be characterized by metabolic parameters that are not typically identified by histopathological analysis alone. Creatine, glycine, and alanine may be used as markers of meningioma grade, recurrence, and the likelihood of rapid recurrence. These data validate a previous study of a separate group of Grade I meningiomas.

Title: High-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy detects glycine as a biomarker in brain tumors.
Abstract: The non-essential amino acid neurotransmitter glycine (Gly) may serve as a biomarker for brain tumors. Using 36 biopsies from patients with brain tumors [12 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); 10 low-grade (LG), including 7 schwannoma and 3 pylocytic astrocytoma; 7 meningioma (MN); 7 brain metastases (MT), including 3 adenocarcinoma and 4 breast cancer] and 9 control biopsies from patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of glycine may distinguish among these brain tumor types. Using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we determined a theoretically optimum echo time (TE) of 50 ms for distinguishing Gly signals from overlapping myo-inositol (Myo) signals and tested our methodology in phantom and biopsy specimens. Quantitative analysis revealed higher levels of Gly in tumor biopsies (all combined) relative to controls; Gly levels were significantly elevated in LG, MT and GBM biopsies (P<or=0.05). Residual Myo levels were elevated in LG and MT and reduced in MN and GBM (P<0.05 vs. control levels). We observed higher levels of Gly in GBM as compared to LG tumors (P=0.05). Meanwhile, although Gly levels in GBM and MT did not differ significantly from each other, the Gly:Myo ratio did distinguish GBM from MT (P<0.003) and from all other groups, a distinction that has not been adequately made previously. We conclude from these findings that Gly can serve as a biomarker for brain tumors and that the Gly:Myo ratio may be a useful index for brain tumor classification.

Title: Relative value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance perfusion, and 2-(18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography for detection of recurrence or grade increase in gliomas.
Abstract: In a consecutive series of 26 previously operated patients diagnosed with cerebral glioma, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), 2-((18)F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and perfusion MRI (MRP), were performed at follow-up to distinguish recurrence from radiation necrosis, and to identify tumour upgrading. Discrepancy between techniques was observed in 9 cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) of each technique to detect the presence of high grade glioma was: MRI, PPV=50%; MRS, PPV=91.6%, NPV=100%; FDG-PET, PPV=75%, NPV=61.1%; MRP, PPV=100%, NPV=100%. In the selected group of nine cases studied to differentiate viable tumour from radiation necrosis, MRS and MRP reached a PPV and a NPV of 100%, whereas for FDG-PET, PPV and NPV were 66.6% and 60%, respectively. To distinguish between viable high-grade glioma and radiation necrosis, gadolinium-enhanced MRI gives a high false-positive rate, while MRS and MRP are superior to FDG-PET in discriminating tumour recurrence, grade increase and radiation necrosis.

Title: Distinguishing glioma recurrence from treatment effect after radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Abstract: Recent advancements have made radiation and chemotherapy the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastomas. The use of these therapies has resulted in an increased diagnosis of pseudoprogression and radiation-induced necrosis. Standard MRI techniques are inadequate in differentiating tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Diagnosis of a posttreatment lesion as glioma recurrence rather than radiochemotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect is critical. This increase in accuracy plays a role as newer immunotherapies incurring posttreatment effects on MRI emerge. Advancements with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional positron emission tomography scans have shown promising capabilities. Further investigations are necessary to assess the imaging algorithms and accuracy of these modalities to differentiate true glioma recurrence from radiotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect.

Title: Primary intracranial extra-axial and supratentorial atypical rhabdoid tumor.
Abstract: An atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system is an aggressive infantile embryonal neoplasm, usually presenting as an infratentorial and intraparenchymatous lesion. We report on magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 22-month-old boy with a biopsy-proven primary rhabdoid tumor, presenting as a single intracranial supratentorial extra-axial mass. Based on the patient's age and imaging features (perfusion, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), a diagnosis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor was more accurate than diagnoses of meningioma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Although this entity is relatively rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dural-based, space-occupying central nervous system lesions.

Title: Identification of mobile lipids in human cancer tissues by ex vivo diffusion edited HR-MAS MRS.
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy visible mobile lipids are considered important markers in the diagnosis of human cancer and are thought to be closely involved in various aspects of tumour transformation, such as cell proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, hypoxia and drug resistance. A method allowing the straightforward identification of the lipid classes contributing to the mobile lipids in human malignant tissues is highly advisable. Ex vivo High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was done directly on human cerebral, renal and colorectal malignant tissue specimens. A diffusion edited sequence, based on stimulated echo and bipolar gradient pulses, was used to characterize molecules with low diffusion rates, arising from mobile lipid components. Cholesterol, triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine are simultaneously detected and all contribute to the mobile lipid resonances present in malignant glioma and clear cell renal carcinoma tissue specimens spectra. On the contrary, papillary cell renal carcinoma spectrum is predominated by phosphatidylcholine resonances and that of colorectal adenocarcinoma is characterized by signals arising from triglycerides. Ex vivo diffusion edited High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, done on intact tissue, is a powerful analytical tool to obtain a simple and immediate identification of mobile lipid components. This can offer a significant contribution to better understanding their involvement in cancer tissues. Furthermore, ex vivo high resolution spectroscopic measurements allow to improve the interpretation of in vivo Magnetic Resonance spectra, increasing its clinical potentiality.

Title: Diagnostic value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the noninvasive grading of solid gliomas: comparison of maximum and mean choline values.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used in addition to magnetic resonance imaging in the characterization of brain tumors. Compounds containing choline (Cho) have an important role in the evaluation of tumor malignancy. For this purpose, various ratios of Cho and other metabolites, such as creatine (Cr), have been assessed. The aim of this study was to compare normalized mean and maximum levels of Cho as single parameters in the noninvasive grading of gliomas. METHODS: Proton spectroscopic imaging data of 63 patients with suspected World Health Organization (WHO) grade II or III gliomas were acquired at 3 T. Cho concentrations of the tumor were analyzed by a frequency domain fit and normalized to the corresponding contralateral healthy brain tissue. Metabolite images were used to determine the maximum and mean Cho as well as Cr concentrations of the tumor. Furthermore, contrast enhancement of the tumor was analyzed on standard magnetic resonance imaging. All patients subsequently underwent tumor resection or stereotactic biopsy to confirm diagnosis of glioma. Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed with BiAS software (Epsilon Verlag GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). RESULTS: Histopathological examinations revealed WHO grades II (n = 27), III (n = 26), and IV (n = 10). There was a statistically significant difference in both normalized maximum and mean Cho between WHO grade II and non-necrotic WHO grade III/IV gliomas (mean, 1.45 +/- 0.28 versus 2.16 +/- 0.36, P < 0.05; maximum, 1.64 +/- 0.32 versus 3.32 +/- 0.55, P < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analyses rendered a 2.02 cutoff value for maximum Cho with a sensitivity and specificity of 86.1% and 77.8%, respectively. For mean Cho, we found a cutoff value of 1.52 (sensitivity, 77.8%; specificity, 63.0%). The diagnostic accuracy of maximum Cho was superior to that of mean Cho and also the ratio of Cho/Cr (82.5% versus 71.4% and 72.1%, respectively), but all 3 parameters were superior to contrast enhancement of the tumor (61.9%). CONCLUSION: Both maximum and mean Cho differ between low- and high-grade gliomas. Compared with contrast enhancement, mean Cho, and Cho/Cr, maximum Cho of the tumor provides the highest accuracy in discriminating between low- and high-grade tumors, indicating usefulness of this single parameter in the process of therapeutic decision making.

Title: New advances that enable identification of glioblastoma recurrence.
Abstract: Postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy have become the standard care for newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. The efficacy of these therapies has led to an increase in pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis, both of which are treatment-related effects whose appearance on standard MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents resembles that of tumor progression or recurrence. Accurate diagnosis of these post-treatment lesions as either tumor recurrence or treatment effects (pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis) is important to determine the patient's prognosis. Modern advancements with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET scans have shown promise for distinguishing tumor recurrence from treatment effects. Advances in radiographic techniques will become critically important with the emergence of new antiangiogenic therapies. Consequently, MRS, DWI, and PET need to be incorporated into routine post-treatment investigations to improve the specificity and sensitivity of distinguishing tumor recurrence from treatment effects. Further research will also be needed to develop improved algorithms that use these modalities, and to develop new modalities with even greater accuracy than those currently available.

Title: Pattern recognition of MRSI data shows regions of glioma growth that agree with DTI markers of brain tumor infiltration.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors and the majority are highly malignant, with one of the worst prognoses for patients. Gliomas are characterized by invasive growth into normal brain tissue that makes complete surgical resection and accurate radiotherapy planning extremely difficult. We have performed independent component analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging data from human gliomas to segment brain tissue into tumor core, tumor infiltration, and normal brain, with confirmation by diffusion tensor imaging analysis. Our data are consistent with previous studies that compared anomalies in isotropic and anisotropic diffusion images to determine regions of potential glioma infiltration. We show that coefficients of independent components can be used to create colored images for easy visual identification of regions of infiltrative tumor growth.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging of tumefactive demyelinating plaque.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted axonography, and diffusion tensor tractography in a patient with tumefactive demyelination plaque (TDP) were evaluated for differential diagnosis from glioblastoma. The findings of glutamate and glutamine elevations on magnetic resonance spectroscopy and apparent tracts within the lesion on axonography and tractography were unlikely to represent glioblastoma, and were thus useful for the preoperative diagnosis of TDP.

Title: Differential diagnosis between radiation necrosis and glioma progression using sequential proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and methionine positron emission tomography.
Abstract: Differential diagnosis between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence is important in the clinical management of glioma. Multi-modality imaging including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET) with L-[methyl-(11)C]methionine (MET) was evaluated. Eighteen patients underwent sequential (1)H-MRS and MET-PET. The expressions of metabolites including choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine phosphate (Cre), and lactate (Lac) were calculated as the ratios of Cho to Cre (Cho/Cre) and Lac to Cho (Lac/Cho). The uptake of MET was determined as the ratio of the lesion to the contralateral reference region (L/R). The final diagnoses were determined by histological examination and/or follow-up MR imaging and clinical course. The Lac/Cho ratio was 0.63 +/- 0.25 (mean +/- standard deviation) in recurrence (7 cases) and 2.35 +/- 1.81 in necrosis (11 cases). The Lac/Cho ratio was significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.01). Consecutive investigation of (1)H-MRS revealed temporary elevation of Cho in 4 of 9 cases of necrosis, which could be identified as false positive findings for recurrence. Including those cases, MET-PET demonstrated significant difference in the L/R ratio between the two groups (2.18 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.35, p < 0.01). According to a 2 x 2 factorial table analysis, the borderline values of Lac/Cho and L/R to differentiate recurrence from necrosis were 1.05 and 2.00, respectively. (1)H-MRS is reliable and accessible for the differentiation of recurrence and necrosis, although the temporary elevation of Cho in the course of necrosis should be recognized. Additional MET-PET imaging can establish the diagnosis.

Abstract: The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and MR perfusion in the follow-up of low-grade gliomas, since conventional MR imaging (MRI) is not reliable in detecting the passage from a low- to high-grade tumor. Twenty-one patients with a World Health Organisation (WHO) grade II glioma were followed up using proton MR spectroscopy, perfusion, and conventional MRIs. Follow-up MRIs had been performed at the third month of evolution and then twice a year, with an average of five MR studies per patient. Five out of the 21 patients had an anaplastic transformation. A choline to creatine ratio (choline/creatine ratio) above 2.4 is associated with an 83% risk of a malignant transformation in an average delay of 15.4 months. The choline/creatine ratio at this threshold was more efficient than perfusion MR in detecting the anaplastic transformation, with sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 94%. An increased choline/creatine ratio seemed to occur an average 15 months before the elevation of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). The mean annual growth of low-grade glioma was 3.65 mm. A growth rate higher than 3 mm per year was also correlated with greater risk of anaplastic transformation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy should be recommended in the follow-up of low-grade gliomas since the choline/creatine ratio can predict anaplastic transformation before perfusion abnormalities, with high positive predictive value of 83%.

Title: Pharmacokinetics and the bystander effect in CD::UPRT/5-FC bi-gene therapy of glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cytosine deaminase (CD) converts 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in CD/5-FC gene therapy, 5-FU will be mostly converted into nontoxic beta-alanine without uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT). UPRT catalyzes the conversion of 5-FU to 5-fluorouridine monophosphate, which directly kills CD::UPRT-expressing cells and surrounding cells via the bystander effect. But the pharmacokinetics and the bystander effect of CD::UPRT/5-FC has not been verified in vivo and in vitro. Before the CD::UPRT/5-FC bi-gene therapy system is used in clinical trial, it is essential to monitor the transgene expression and function in vivo. Thus, we developed a preclinical tumor model to investigate the feasibility of using (19)F-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F-MRS) and optical imaging to measure non-invasive CD and UPRT expression and its bystander effect. METHODS: C6 and C6-CD::UPRT cells were cultured with 5-FC. The medium, cells and their mixture were analyzed by (19)F-MRS. Rats with intracranial xenografted encephalic C6-CD::UPRT glioma were injected intraperitoneally with 5-FC and their (19)F-MRS spectra recorded. Then the pharmacokinetics of 5-FC was proved. Mixtures of C6 and C6-CD::UPRT cells at different ratios were cultured with 5-FC and the cytotoxic efficacy and survival rate of cells recorded. To determine the mechanism of the bystander effect, the culture media from cell comprising 25% and 75% C6-CD::UPRT cells were examined by (19)F-MRS. A comparative study of mean was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: (19)F-MRS on samples from C6-CD::UPRT cells cultured with 5-FC showed three broad resonance signals corresponding to 5-FC, 5-FU and fluorinated nucleotides (F-Nuctd). For the C6 mixture, only the 5-FC peak was detected. In vivo serial (19)F-MRS spectra showed a strong 5-FC peak and a weak 5-FU peak at 20 minutes after 5-FC injection. The 5-FU concentration reached a maximum at about 50 minutes. The F-Nuctd signal appeared after about 1 hour, reached a maximum at around 160 minutes, and was detectable for several hours. At a 10% ratio of C6-CD::UPRT cells, the survival rate was (79.55 +/- 0.88)% (P < 0.01). As the C6-CD::UPRT ratio increased, the survival rate of the cells decreased. (19)F-MRS showed that the signals for 5-FU and F-Nuctd in the culture medium increased as the ratio of C6-CD::UPRT in the mixture increased. CONCLUSIONS: (19)F-MRS studies indicated that C6-CD::UPRT cells could effectively express CD and UPRT enzymes. The CD::UPRT/5-FC system showed an obvious bystander effect. This study demonstrated that CD::UPRT/5-FC gene therapy is suitable for 5-FC to F-Nuctd metabolism; and (19)F-MRS can monitor transferred CD::UPRT gene expression and catalysis of substrates noninvasively, dynamically and quantitatively.

Title: Recurrence of intracranial meningiomas: did better methods of diagnosis and surgical treatment change the outcome in the last 30 years?
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas are benign intracranial tumors growing from the arachnoid cap cells. Although their behavior is usually benign, they tend to recur even after total removal, and their recurrence is dependent on different aspects. METHODS: Between 1991 and 2002, 463 patients with an intracranial meningioma were operated in the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany. We compared the outcome of these patients after operation and the different methods of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the data from Buhl (1994), who analysed 661 patients with intracranial meningioma who were operated on in the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Essen, Essen, Germany, between 1968 and 1988, to find out whether better methods of diagnosis like magnetic resonance imaging scans, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, post-operative radiation therapy and chemotherapy have an influence on the recurrence and outcome after surgical treatment. RESULTS: The patients' mean age in both studies was between 50 and 59 years. Both studies underlined the preponderance of female patients for intracranial meningiomas. In the primary study, there were 506 female and 208 male patients, and in the new study, there were 366 female and 97 male patients. The gender distribution changed from 2.4 : 1 to 3.8 : 1. Complete removal of the tumor was possible in 86.7% in both studies. The recurrence rate in the first study was 11% (73/661), while it was 16% in the second study (73/463). The intracranial localization of the meningiomas was similar to the distribution of the histological subtypes and the rate of recurrence; only the malignant meningiomas showed a higher grade of recurrence in the last study. Indications for post-operative radiation therapy were given earlier in the last study owing to the experience from the primary study. The outcome of the patients after surgical removal was improving in the last years; the 30 day post-operative mortality after a primary operation on an intracranial meningioma decreased from 12.1 to 3%. After removal of a recurrent meningioma, the mortality declined from 20 to 12.5%. CONCLUSION: In the last 30 years, nothing important changed at the time of appearance of meningiomas, concerning the gender distribution and localisation as well as histological subtypes. With better operating modalities and additional treatment with radiation and gamma knife, the mortality decreased significantly from 12 to 3% and the outcome of the patients is still improving, so that even elderly patients with intracranial meningioma can undergo surgical treatment with minor risks.

Title: Metabolic alterations in the peritumoral brain in cases of meningiomas: 1H-MRS study.
Abstract: The objective of the present study was metabolic characterization of the peritumoral brain in the vicinity of meningiomas using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). Data of long-echo (TR: 2000 ms, TE: 136 ms) single-voxel spectroscopic investigations were obtained during preoperative examination of 81 patients (19 men and 62 women; mean age, 56.5 years). Twenty-seven neoplasms were disclosed incidentally. Moderate-to-severe peritumoral edema was presented in 20 cases. Invasive growth of the tumor was macroscopically identified during surgery in 35 cases. Analyzed metabolites included N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho), mobile lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac). Compared to distant normal-appearing white matter (1)H-MRS of the brain in the vicinity of meningiomas disclosed statistically significant decrease of NAA content (P=0.0019). Investigated metabolic parameters depended on the presence of invasive tumor growth and prominent peritumoral edema, as well as on the size of the neoplasm, its location, and the patient's age. More severe (1)H-MRS-detected peritumoral metabolic abnormalities associated with invasive growth of meningioma might be used for its prediction. The presence of meningioma-related neurological symptoms was mainly determined by the size of the tumor, while might be also associated with lower normalized NAA/Cho ratio and more frequent presence of a Lip peak in the peritumoral brain. In conclusion, decrease of NAA content constitutes the most prominent (1)H-MRS-detected brain abnormality in the vicinity of intracranial meningiomas. Peritumoral spectroscopic alterations are determined by a variety of factors, can be predictive for invasive tumor growth and may correspond to presented neurological symptoms.

Title: A comparison between radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and hyperpolarized (13)C-labeled pyruvate utilization as methods for detecting tumor response to treatment.
Abstract: Detection of early tumor responses to treatment can give an indication of clinical outcome. Positron emission tomography measurements of the uptake of the glucose analog, [(18)F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), have demonstrated their potential for detecting early treatment response in the clinic. We have shown recently that (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging measurements of the uptake and conversion of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate into [1-(13)C]lactate can be used to detect treatment response in a murine lymphoma model. The present study compares these magnetic resonance measurements with changes in FDG uptake after chemotherapy. A decrease in FDG uptake was found to precede the decrease in flux of hyperpolarized (13)C label between pyruvate and lactate, both in tumor cells in vitro and in tumors in vivo. However, the magnitude of the decrease in FDG uptake and the decrease in pyruvate to lactate flux was comparable at 24 hours after drug treatment. In cells, the decrease in FDG uptake was shown to correlate with changes in plasma membrane expression of the facilitative glucose transporters, whereas the decrease in pyruvate to lactate flux could be explained by an increase in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and subsequent depletion of the NAD(H) pool. These results show that measurement of flux between pyruvate and lactate may be an alternative to FDG-positron emission tomography for imaging tumor treatment response in the clinic.

Title: Spectral changes in postoperative MRS in high-grade gliomas and their effect on patient prognosis.
Abstract: The aim of the study was to find differences in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) which might facilitate differential diagnosis between tumour regrowth and a remnant tumour with present postradiation changes or postradiation necrosis in the vicinity of the postoperative bed, based on the assessment of the dynamics between two MRS, i.e. preoperative and postoperative scanning, performed at 6 months after surgery. Therefore, in 9 patients with high-grade gliomas, MRS spectra were obtained. Subsequently, a partial tumour resection was done in 5 patients, and 4 subjects underwent a gross total resection. On the second MRS the voxel was placed on an observed contrast enhancement area. The tumour regrowth onset was established by comparing the results of control MRI with postoperative CT scans, and also on the basis of changes in clinical condition as well as a further follow-up, including MRI studies. In patients with tumour regrowth Cho/NAA and Lac/Cr ratios increased and the NAA/Cr ratio decreased between the two MRS studies; in the patients without regrowth, the ratio changes were inverse. In both groups, a decrease in Cho/Cr ratio was observed. In a univariate analysis the presence of tumour regrowth and an increase in Cho/NAA ratio between the two MRS were correlated with a shorter further survival time; a tendency to shorter further survival time was noted with decrease in NAA/Cr ratio. In conclusion, MRS is a diagnostic tool which, on the basis of direction of changes in the value of metabolite ratios, helps additionally confirm the diagnosis of glioma regrowth. In the case of a visible contrast enhancement area on the postoperative MRI with observed concomitant increase in Cho/NAA ratio and decrease in NAA/Cr ratio between pre- and postoperative MRS examinations, preliminary suspicion should be that of glioma regrowth rather than of remnant tumour after surgery or postradiation lesions.

Title: Myoinositol trends in different types of brain lesions.
Abstract: Myoinositol (Myo) is a not yet well known metabolite detected using short echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HMRS). We examined the role of Myo in 26 patients with new diagnosis of brain lesions including tumors, inflammatory and infectious processes. Histological confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained during gross total surgical resection or stereotactic biopsy of the lesions. The highest ratios of Myo/Cr were found in the hemangiopericytoma and meningioma followed by cortical dysplasia, low grade gliomas, gliobastomas, lymphomas, demyelinating lesions and toxoplasmosis. There was no Myo detected in the cases of metastasis and abscess. Increased Myo levels correlated with low grade gliomas suggesting its potential use in the differentiation of glial tumor. Myo demonstrated a unique pattern in hemangiopericytoma.

Title: Adult medulloblastoma and the "dural-tail" sign: rare mimic of a posterior petrous meningioma.
Abstract: The authors describe clinical and radiological features of a 32-year-old male patient with a posterior fossa lesion. The radiological characteristics resembled an extra-axial lesion; a meningioma, with attachment to the tentorium and petrous bone. The histological diagnosis was classical medulloblastoma. We review literature of this atypical presentation of medulloblastoma and "dural-tail" sign, which can be associated with other benign or malignant lesions. The role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumors is discussed.

Title: Lipid signal in evaluation of intracranial meningiomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Using magnetic resonance imaging, diagnosis of malignant meningioma from benign meningioma with atypical features is uncertain. We evaluated the value of lipid signal in differentiating intracranial meningiomas. METHODS: 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using a point resolved spectroscopy (TR/TE 1000/144 ms) sequences were performed on 34 patients on a 3.0 T scanner. Lipid peak located at 1.3 ppm was evaluated. MRS data from these tumours were compared with histopathological findings (including hematoxylin and eosin staining and KP-1 staining). RESULTS: Twenty-nine meningiomas were histologically benign (eleven meningothelial, thirteen fibrous, four transitional and one microcystic), three were atypical, and two were anaplastic. Lipid signal was detected in ten cases: two anaplastic, three atypical, two fibrous and three meningothelial meningiomas. All voxels with lipid peak in the spectrum from the tumour were evaluated. With creatinine peak in the normal white matter chosen as internal standard, lipid/creatinine ratios of anaplastic, atypical and benign meningiomas were 0.844 +/- 0.027 (range from 0.725 to 0.994), 0.465 +/- 0.023 (range from 0.239 to 0.724), and 0.373 +/- 0.016 (range from 0.172 to 0.571) respectively. Highly significant differences were noted between anaplastic and the other two subtypes. Patchy necrosis was observed in anaplastic meningioma, while focal necrosis was noted in atypical meningioma with HE stain. However, no necrosis was found in benign group. KP-1 stain demonstrated histocytes containing lipids in the necrotic region of anaplastic and atypical meningioma. CONCLUSION: The lipid signal at 1.3 ppm is a useful marker in evaluating the malignancy of intracranial meningiomas, especially in the differential diagnosis of anaplastic meningioma.

Title: 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of endothelial cells grown in three-dimensional matrigel construct as an enabling platform technology: I. The effect of glial cells and valproic acid on phosphometabolite levels.
Abstract: Very few studies describe endothelial cell (EC) properties under three-dimensional (3D) conditions using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The authors developed a model in which living ECs growing in Matrigel threads (3D conditions) for 5 days are monitored by (31)P MRS, providing the fingerprint of the major EC phosphometabolites. Organic extracts of membranal phospholipids were also analyzed by (31)P MRS. For comparison and as a model for two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture conditions, (31)P MRS spectra of aqueous extracts of EC phosphometabolites grown under 2D conditions were also evaluated. The phosphometabolites fingerprint of the cells cultured under 3D was significantly different from that of ECs maintained under 2D. Moreover, the pattern of phosphometabolites was affected by coculture with C6-glioma cells and upon treatment with valproic acid, which is under clinical investigation as an antioangiogenic anticancer drug. The major effects were modulation of (i) energy metabolism intermediates such as phosphocreatine, (ii) precursors of phospholipids such as phosphomonoesters, and (iii) degradation products of phospholipids such as glycerophosphocholine. This endothelial model will be usefull as an enabling platform technology for tissue engineering.

Title: Absolute choline concentration measured by quantitative proton MR spectroscopy correlates with cell density in meningioma.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and pathological changes in meningioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two meningioma cases underwent single voxel 1H-MRS (point-resolved spectroscopy sequence, repetition time/echo time = 2,000 ms/68, 136, 272 ms). Absolute choline (Cho) concentration was calculated using tissue water as the internal reference and corrected according to intra-voxel cystic/necrotic parts. Pathological specimens were stained with MIB-1 antibody to measure cell density and proliferation index. Correlation analysis was performed between absolute Cho concentration and cell density and MIB-1 labeled proliferation index. RESULTS: Average Cho concentration of all meningiomas before correction was 2.95 +/- 0.86 mmol/kg wet weight. It was increased to 3.23 +/- 1.15 mmol/kg wet weight after correction. Average cell density of all meningiomas was 333 +/- 119 cells/HPF, and average proliferation index was 2.93 +/- 5.72%. A linear, positive correlation between cell density and Cho concentration was observed (r = 0.650, P = 0.001). After correction of Cho concentration, the correlation became more significant (r = 0.737, P < 0.001). However, no significant correlation between Cho concentration and proliferation index was found. There seemed to be a positive correlation trend after correction of Cho concentration but did not reach significant level. CONCLUSION: Absolute Cho concentration, especially Cho concentration corrected according to intra-voxel cystic/necrotic parts, reflects cell density of meningioma.

Title: In vivo (19)F MRI and (19)F MRS of (19)F-labelled boronophenylalanine-fructose complex on a C6 rat glioma model to optimize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).
Abstract: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising binary modality used to treat malignant brain gliomas. To optimize BNCT effectiveness a non-invasive method is needed to monitor the spatial distribution of BNCT carriers in order to estimate the optimal timing for neutron irradiation. In this study, in vivo spatial distribution mapping and pharmacokinetics evaluation of the (19)F-labelled boronophenylalanine (BPA) were performed using (19)F magnetic resonance imaging ((19)F MRI) and (19)F magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F MRS). Characteristic uptake of (19)F-BPA in C6 glioma showed a maximum at 2.5 h after compound infusion as confirmed by both (19)F images and (19)F spectra acquired on blood samples collected at different times after infusion. This study shows the ability of (19)F MRI to selectively map the bio-distribution of (19)F-BPA in a C6 rat glioma model, as well as providing a useful method to perform pharmacokinetics of BNCT carriers.

Title: Multiproject-multicenter evaluation of automatic brain tumor classification by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: JUSTIFICATION: Automatic brain tumor classification by MRS has been under development for more than a decade. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, there are no published evaluations of predictive models with unseen cases that are subsequently acquired in different centers. The multicenter eTUMOUR project (2004-2009), which builds upon previous expertise from the INTERPRET project (2000-2002) has allowed such an evaluation to take place. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 253 pairwise classifiers for glioblastoma, meningioma, metastasis, and low-grade glial diagnosis were inferred based on 211 SV short TE INTERPRET MR spectra obtained at 1.5 T (PRESS or STEAM, 20-32 ms) and automatically pre-processed. Afterwards, the classifiers were tested with 97 spectra, which were subsequently compiled during eTUMOUR. RESULTS: In our results based on subsequently acquired spectra, accuracies of around 90% were achieved for most of the pairwise discrimination problems. The exception was for the glioblastoma versus metastasis discrimination, which was below 78%. A more clear definition of metastases may be obtained by other approaches, such as MRSI + MRI. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of the tumor type of in-vivo MRS is possible using classifiers developed from previously acquired data, in different hospitals with different instrumentation under the same acquisition protocols. This methodology may find application for assisting in the diagnosis of new brain tumor cases and for the quality control of multicenter MRS databases.

Title: Neuroimaging of infections of the central nervous system.
Abstract: Neuroimaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of neurologic infections. This article summarizes imaging findings in brain abscesses, ventriculitis, viral diseases, and opportunistic infections. In cases of uncomplicated meningitis, cranial computed tomography is sufficient to exclude brain edema, hydrocephalus, and skull base pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior in depicting complications (e.g., empyema, vasculitis). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) shows parenchymal complications of meningitis earlier and is of help in differentiation of pyogenic abscess from other ring-enhancing lesions. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can produce specific peak-patterns in cases of abscess, such as the presence of lactate and cytosolic amino acids. In toxoplasmosis, DWI may help to differentiate from lymphoma, showing no restriction of water diffusion. In patients with viral encephalitis, DWI allows earlier lesion detection. MRI has revolutionized the rapid diagnosis of spinal abscess.

Title: Possible role of single-voxel (1)H-MRS in differential diagnosis of suprasellar tumors.
Abstract: The objective of the present study was investigation of the possible role of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for differential diagnosis of suprasellar tumors. Forty patients (23 men and 17 women; median age, 45 years) with suprasellar, hypothalamic, and third ventricle neoplasms underwent long-echo (TR: 2000 ms, TE: 136 ms, 128-256 acquisitions) single-voxel (1)H-MRS before surgical treatment. The volume of the voxel was either 3.4 cc or 8 cc. Spectroscopic data were analyzed by calculation of the various metabolite ratios as well as by determination of the type of the pathological (1)H-MR spectra. There were 19 pituitary adenomas, 7 gliomas, 5 craniopharyngiomas, 3 chordomas, meningioma, hemangiopericytoma, malignant lymphoma, germinoma, Rathke cleft cyst, and hypothalamic hamartoma (one of each). Six tumors were recurrent after initial surgical resection with or without irradiation. Comparison of the individual metabolite ratios revealed only few subtle differences among neoplasms. In the same time, pattern analysis with determination of the type of the pathological (1)H-MR spectra disclosed certain specific characteristics, which seemingly can be used for tumor typing. Meanwhile, metabolic imaging was less effective for characterization of recurrent neoplasms. In conclusion, in cases of initially diagnosed suprasellar tumors with involvement of the hypothalamus and extension into the third ventricle pattern analysis of the single-voxel (1)H-MRS can provide valuable information, which, in addition to structural MRI, can be effectively used for diagnostic purposes.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) and brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for radiotherapy treatment planning of glioma.
Abstract: Conventional radiotherapy of glioma is ineffective due to uncertainties in target delineation, inadequate radiation dose, and difficulties in identifying radio-resistant high-grade tumor for dose escalation. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide information on altered metabolic activity of tumor cells and functionally critical brain tissues, which are not available from anatomical imaging. In this paper, we review the pathological and physiological information that might be derived from MRSI and fMRI to better delineate the treatment volume and critical organs for glioma radiotherapy. Technical difficulties for incorporating MRSI and fMRI into radiotherapy treatment planning process are discussed and potential solutions are presented. A fusion protocol is used to illustrate the feasibility of registering MRSI and fMRI with simulation CT for one glioma case. An IMRT (intensity-modulated radiotherapy) dose painting plan for this case is also presented using the fused MRSI and fMRI to delineate the clinical target volumes and Broca's area.

Title: [Value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with two-dimensional chemical-shift imaging in evaluating brain gliomas].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) with two-dimensional (2D) chemical-shift imaging (CSI) in evaluating brain gliomas. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with gliomas received examinations with 2D-CSI. The VOI of MRS included the tumor, peritumoral edematous and nonedematous areas, and the contralateral normal tissue. The changes of the metabolites in different areas were determined using 2D-CSI (1)H-MRS with SE sequence and the metabolite ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the ratios of NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho between low-grade gliomas and contralateral normal brain tissue, and between high-grade gliomas and the contralateral normal tissue (P<0.01). The low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas differed significantly in the ratios of NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho (P<0.05). These ratios also showed significant differences between peritumoral edematous area and the glioma tissue, between the peritumoral edematous area and contralateral normal brain tissue (P<0.05), and between the peritumoral nonedematous area and the glioma tissue (P<0.05). Between the peritumoral nonedematous area and contralateral normal brain tissue, NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios were significantly different (P<0.05) but the Cho/Cr ratio was similar (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MRS with 2D-CSI can provide precise and effective evidences with high time resolution for glioma grading, assessment of peritumoral involvement and glioma therapies.

Title: Amyloidoma presenting as a butterfly glioma on positron emission tomography scan and magnetic resonance-spectroscopy: a case report and review of the literature.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Isolated amyloidoma rarely involves the nervous system. MATERIALS: We report a patient with progressively worsening triparesis and numbness in his extremities. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a mass lesion involving both hemispheres, which on positron emission tomography (PET) scan and magnetic resonance-spectroscopy (MR-SPECT) appeared to be a butterfly glioma. However, neuropathological examination revealed a large area with localized vascular amyloidosis. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of a localized central nervous system vascular amyloid to imitate a butterfly glioma on MRI and PET scan studies.

Title: New observations concerning the interpretation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy of meningioma.
Abstract: This study was aimed to clarify some ambiguities in the interpretation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of meningiomas. The cases of 31 meningioma patients (27 benign and 4 nonbenign meningiomas) that underwent single-voxel 1H-MRS (PRESS sequence, TR/TE = 2,000 ms/68, 136, 272 ms) were retrospectively analyzed. To verify the findings of in-vivo study, phantoms were measured, and pathological sections of 11 patients were reviewed. All meningiomas demonstrated increased choline and decreased creatine, except for a lipomatous meningioma that only displayed a prominent lipid (Lip) peak. Alanine (Ala) and lactate (Lac) coexisted in eight cases, indicating an alternative pathway of energy metabolism in meningiomas. They partially overlapped with each other and demonstrated a triplet-like spectral pattern, which was consistent with phantom study. Glutamine/glutamate (Glx) was helpful for the recognition of meningioma when Ala was absent. N-acetyl compounds(NACs) were observed in nine cases whose voxels were completely limited within the tumors, indicating that meningiomas might have endogenous NACs. Lac was indicative of an aggressive meningioma, although not always a nonbenign one. Lip not only represented micronecrosis in nonbenign meningiomas, but also reflected microcystic changes or fatty degeneration in benign meningiomas. 1H-MRS reflects some distinctive biochemical and pathological changes of meningiomas that might be misinterpreted.

Title: Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis mimics high-grade astrocytoma.
Abstract: The incidence of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis, an infection caused by a dark-pigmented fungus, is increasing. The infection may mimic a high-grade glioma clinically and radiographically. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be helpful in differentiating the two. We report two cases to increase the awareness of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in the clinical neurosciences. Early biopsy establishing the diagnosis, followed by aggressive combined surgical and medical management is necessary for a good outcome.

Title: Tissue characterization of glioma by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: glioma grading and histological correlation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our intent was to clarify the usefulness of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PW-MRI) in the grading of glioma. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with gliomas were investigated by both proton MRS and PW-MRI. For quantitative analysis, the metabolite data of the gliomas were estimated using the LCModel software. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were also performed to assess which metabolite parameter was optimal for discrimination of glioma grade. From the PW-MRI data, the value of blood volume was measured on the parametric map corresponding to the location of MRS analysis. We then compared tumor blood volume with the amount of choline (Cho). RESULTS: The mean Cho/creatine (Cre) ratio was useful to discriminate between Grades II and III, and the mean lactate (Lac)/Cre ratio was found to be significantly different between Grades III and IV. ROC curve analysis showed that measurements involving Cho were superior indices for grading glioma compared with blood volume information. Furthermore, the correlation between tumor blood volume and the amount of choline was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: MRS may provide valuable information for glioma grading.

Title: [Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in postoperative radiochemotherapy of patients with cerebral glioblastoma].
Abstract: The paper discusses the data from dynamic follow-up of immunohistologically confirmed glioblastomas of the brain using proton magnetic resonance imaging (+H MRI) (25). Study was undertaken before and after therapy and resumed for 6-8 months after. Cholin concentration peaks and N-acetyl-aspartate decrease in gliomas appeared to be higher than those in anaplastic astrocytomas. Moreover, N-acetyl-aspartate peaks were obliterated by large necrotic areas in glioblastoma. Instead, lipid and lactate concentrations peaked thus suggesting pathological changes. A necrotic area developed in the course of radiochemotherapy involving peaks for wide profile of lipid and lactate concentrations coupled with lowered levels of other metabolites.

Title: Differentiation of High-Grade and Low-Grade Gliomas Using Pattern Analysis of Long-Echo Single-Voxel Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS).
Abstract: The usefulness of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for glioma grading is not clear, particularly due to the absence of standard criteria for data analysis. Previously we had developed an original classification of the pathological (1)H-MRS spectra based on the identification of the predominant metabolite peak, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) for Type I, choline-containing compounds (Cho) for Type II, and mobile lipids (Lip) for Type III, and presence or absence of other metabolite peaks: lactate (Lac), Lip, or Cho. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of this classification in grading of previously non-treated gliomas. A total of 38 low-grade and 33 high-grade neoplasms were investigated. Four tumors had (1)H-MRS spectra Type I, and all of those were low-grade. Three tumors had (1)H-MRS spectra Type III, and all those were glioblastomas. Fifteen tumors with (1)H-MRS spectra Type II had a Lip/NAA ratio more than 1 (Type II C with moderate elevation of lipids), and 12 of those neoplasms were high-grade. The differences in distribution of high-grade and low-grade gliomas among another 49 gliomas with (1)H-MRS spectra Type II did not depend on the presence of Lac and/or Lip peaks, and in this subgroup NAA/Cho ratio was also evaluated. Inclusion of both characteristics (type of the (1)H-MRS spectrum and NAA/Cho ratio with defined cut-off level of 0.6) into the diagnostic algorithm yielded 72% diagnostic accuracy (95% confidence interval: 62%-82%) in discriminating high-grade and low-grade neoplasms. In conclusion, pattern analysis of the pathological (1)H-MRS spectra using the proposed classification along with evaluation of NAA/Cho ratio might be helpful for non-invasive glioma grading.

Title: Neurosurgical implications of mannitol accumulation within a meningioma and its peritumoral region demonstrated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy: case report.
Abstract: Mannitol is widely considered the hyperosmolar therapy of choice in routine neurosurgical practice for the reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP). The authors present a unique case of a patient with a large meningioma treated with mannitol, in which mannitol accumulation within the tumor and its surrounding parenchyma was shown using in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This rare appearance of mannitol on MRS was characterized by a wide-based peak at 3.8 ppm, which remained detectable several hours after the last dose. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in support of the prevailing theory that mannitol leakage into the peritumoral edematous region may contribute to rebound increases in ICP and suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur in extraaxial tumors. Judicious use of mannitol in the setting of elevated ICP due to tumor may be indicated to avoid potentially deleterious side effects caused by its accumulation.

Title: Targeting regions with highest lipid content on MR spectroscopy may improve diagnostic yield in stereotactic biopsy.
Abstract: Gliomas are heterogeneous brain tumors and prognosis and treatment are dependent on the highest histological grade present. Stereotactic biopsy is associated with an inherent risk of sampling error. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) uses clinical MR scanners to provide chemical in addition to conventional information. MRS studies in brain tumors have found increased levels of choline-containing compounds (Cho) and decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) which are all associated with increased grade of glioma. We propose the use of MRS-guided stereotactic biopsy of astrocytomas to increase diagnostic yield and reduce the sampling error rate. MRS was performed on two patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy for suspected astrocytoma. Spectral peak heights of the metabolites Cho at 3.2 parts per million (ppm) chemical shift, NAA at 2.0 ppm and lipid (Lip) at 1.2 ppm, were measured. Biopsy targets were selected from the voxels with the highest Cho/NAA and normalised against Cho levels in the contralateral normal tissue, as well as those with highest lipid content. The biopsies were taken and tissue diagnosis was obtained via standard histological techniques. Histological grade was found to be different in one case: the region with a high Lip/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios showed glioblastoma, whereas the region with high Cho/NAA but low Lip/Cr ratios showed anaplastic astrocytoma. The second patient had high Cho/NAA ratio but low Lip/Cr ratio in both targets and the histology revealed anaplastic astrocytoma in both samples. MRS is a useful biomedical imaging tool for diagnosing and grading astrocytomas. Targeting regions with highest lipid content can potentially improve the diagnostic yield and minimize sampling error in stereotactic biopsy.

Title: Serum alpha 2-HS glycoprotein predicts survival in patients with glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has variable prognosis. We aimed to identify serum biomarkers that predict survival of patients with glioblastoma. METHODS: In phase 1 (biomarker discovery), SELDI-TOF mass spectra were studied in 200 serum samples from 58 control subjects and 36 patients with grade II astrocytoma, 15 with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 91 with glioblastoma. To identify potential biomarkers, we searched for peptide peaks that changed progressively in size with increasing malignancy. One peak, identified as the B-chain of alpha 2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), was less prominent with increasing tumor grade. We therefore investigated AHSG as a survival predictor in glioblastoma. We measured serum AHSG by turbidimetry and determined indices of malignancy, including tumor proliferation (Ki67 immunolabel) and necrosis (tumor lipids on magnetic resonance spectroscopy). In phase 2 (biomarker validation), the prognostic power of AHSG was validated in an independent group of 72 glioblastoma patients. RESULTS: Median survival was longer (51 vs 29 weeks) in glioblastoma patients with normal vs low serum AHSG concentrations (hazard ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-5.0, P <0.001), independent of age and Karnofsky score. Serum AHSG inversely correlated with Ki-67 immunolabeling and tumor lipids. A prognostic index combining serum AHSG with patient age and Karnofsky score separated glioblastoma patients with short (<3 months) and long (>2 years) median survival. The prognostic value of serum AHSG was validated in a different cohort of glioblastoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that serum AHSG concentration, measured before starting treatment, predicts survival in patients with glioblastoma.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy predicts proliferative activity in diffuse low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of (1)HMRS to reflect proliferative activity of diffuse low-grade gliomas (WHO grade II). Between November 2002 and March 2007, a prospective study was performed on consecutive patients with suspected supratentorial hemispheric diffuse low-grade tumors. All the patients underwent MR examination using uniform procedures, and then surgical resection or biopsy within 2 weeks of the MR examination. Proliferative activity of the tumors was assessed by Ki-67 immunochemistry (Mb-1) on paraffin embedded tumor sections. Spectroscopic data was compared with Ki-67 labeling index and other histologic data such as histological subtype, cellular atypia, cellular density using univariate and multivariate analysis. 82 of 97 consecutive patients had histologically confirmed WHO grade 2 gliomas. Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) was correlated with specific spectral patterns: (1) low PI (<4%) was associated with increased Cho/Cr and absence of both free lipids or lactates; (2) intermediate PI (4-8%) was associated with resonance of lactates; and (3) high PI (>8%) was characterized by a resonance of free lipids. On multivariate analysis, resonance of lactates and resonance of free lipids appeared as independent predictors of intermediate PI (P < 0.001) and high PI (P < 0.001), respectively; moreover, free lipids resonance was correlated with cellular atypia (P < 0.05). This study suggests that (1)HMRS is a reliable tool to evaluate the proliferation activity of WHO grade 2 glioma and to identify potentially more aggressive clinical behavior.

Title: Fluorescent in situ hybridization and ex vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic examinations of meningioma tumor tissue: is it possible to identify a clinically-aggressive subset of benign meningiomas?
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although histologically benign, Grade I meningiomas can sometimes behave aggressively. The clinically-aggressive subset of Grade I meningiomas is typically indistinguishable from clinically-benign Grade I meningiomas in vivo. We compared molecular genetic and biochemical findings to clinical, pathological, and immunohistochemical information in a series of clinically-aggressive Grade I meningiomas with a series of clinically-benign meningiomas to identify characteristics that may be used to distinguish between these two groups. METHODS: Tumor tissue samples from 30 patients with Grade I meningiomas were harvested. Half of the sample was embedded in paraffin to be used for fluorescent in situ hybridization to examine aberrations of chromosomes 1p, 14q, and 22q; the other half was snap frozen and examined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify concentrations of key metabolites in the tissue ex vivo. Clinical and pathological parameters were retrospectively reviewed as part of routine clinical management. These data were evaluated for potential unique associations with diagnostic significance. RESULTS: Molecular genetic and biochemical findings correlated with clinical behavior of the two Grade I meningioma groups. Specific chromosomal abnormalities correlated with the aggressive phenotype: homogeneous loss of 1p, homogeneous loss of 14q, and the presence of any of the examined chromosomal aberrations (P < 0.05). The presence of aberrations also influenced meningioma regrowth after subtotal resection. The ratio of choline to glutamate correlated with histopathological subtype (P < 0.05). The ratio of glutamine to glutamate, and the ratio of glycine to total glutamine and glutamate, and creatine correlated with recurrence. Alanine was decreased in meningiomas with chromosomal aberrations in tumors that recurred. CONCLUSION: Distinct molecular genetic and biochemical alterations differentiated clinically-aggressive Grade I meningiomas from clinically-benign Grade I meningiomas.

Title: Diffusion tensor imaging and chemical shift imaging assessment of heterogeneity in low grade glioma under temozolomide chemotherapy.
Abstract: Diffusion tensor imaging and multiple voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed in the MRI follow-up of a patient with a glioma treated with temozolomide chemotherapy. Tumor shrinkage was paralleled by reductions in choline level and by increases in apparent diffusion coefficient indicating decreased cellularity. Within the tumor, choline level and apparent diffusion coefficient showed a significant inverse correlation (P < 0.01). Fractional anisotropy distribution in the tumor correlated positively with N-acetyl aspartate level (P < 0.001), indicating that these parameters reflect (remaining) axonal structure. Tumor lactate level, also found to decrease under therapy, did not correlate with any other parameter.

Title: In vivo monitoring response to chemotherapy of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma xenografts in SCID mice by 1H and 31P MRS.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: A reliable noninvasive method for in vivo detection of early therapeutic response of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients would be of great clinical value. This study evaluates the feasibility of (1)H and (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo detection of response to combination chemotherapy of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL2) xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, hydroxy doxorubicin, Oncovin, prednisone, and bryostatin 1 (CHOPB) was administered to tumor-bearing SCID mice weekly for up to four cycles. Spectroscopic studies were performed before the initiation of treatment and after each cycle of the CHOPB. Proton MRS for detection of lactate and total choline was performed using a selective multiple-quantum-coherence-transfer (Sel-MQC) and a spin-echo-enhanced Sel-MQC (SEE-Sel-MQC) pulse sequence, respectively. Phosphorus-31 MRS using a nonlocalized, single-pulse sequence without proton decoupling was also performed on these animals. RESULTS: Significant decreases in lactate and total choline were detected in the DLCL2 tumors after one cycle of CHOPB chemotherapy. The ratio of phosphomonoesters to beta-nucleoside triphosphate (PME/betaNTP, measured by (31)P MRS) significantly decreased in the CHOPB-treated tumors after two cycles of CHOPB. The control tumors did not exhibit any significant changes in either of these metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that (1)H and (31)P MRS can detect in vivo therapeutic response of NHL tumors and that lactate and choline offer a number of advantages over PMEs as markers of early therapeutic response.

Title: Quantitative assessment of gliomas by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) techniques provide physiological and metabolic information that complements the anatomical information available from conventional MR imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in preoperative quantitative assessment of intracranial gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with histologically verified gliomas, comprising 2 cases with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, grade 4), 5 cases with anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO, grade 3; high-grade glioma), and 1 case with fibrillary astrocytoma (FA, grade 2; low-grade glioma) were evaluated using the 1H-MRS protocol following conventional MR imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) preoperatively. RESULTS: High-grade gliomas tended to demonstrate signal hyperintensity by DWI and higher relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) by PWI. Increased ratios of choline (Cho) to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) (Cho/NAA) and Cho to creatine (Cr) (Cho/Cr) correlated highly with tumor malignancy. The presence of lactate and lipid was predominately detected in patients with high-grade glioma. CONCLUSION: The combination of multiple MR parameters, based on DWI, PWI and 1H-MRS, appears valuable for preoperatively predicting the degree of malignancy in glioma.

Title: Multiparametric differentiation of posterior fossa tumors in children using diffusion-weighted imaging and short echo-time 1H-MR spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the combined value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in differentiating medulloblastoma, ependymoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and infiltrating glioma in a pediatric population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 17 children with untreated posterior fossa tumors (seven medulloblastoma, four infiltrating glioma, two ependymoma, and four pilocytic astrocytoma), were investigated with conventional MRI, DWI, and MRS using a single-voxel technique. Within the nonnecrotic tumor core, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values using a standardized region of interest (ROI) were retrieved. Quantification of water signal and analysis of metabolite signals from MRS measurements in the same tumorous area were reviewed using multivariant linear discriminant analysis. RESULTS: Combination of ADC values and metabolites, which were normalized using water as an internal standard, allowed discrimination between the four tumor groups with a likelihood below 1 x 10(-9). Positive predictive value was 1 in all cases. Tumors could not be discriminated when using metabolite ratios or ADC values alone, nor could they be differentiated using creatine (Cr) as an internal reference even in combination with ADC values. CONCLUSION: Linear discriminant analysis using DWI and MRS using water as internal reference, fully discriminates the four most frequent posterior fossa tumors in children.

Title: Detecting tumor response to treatment using hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.
Abstract: Measurements of early tumor responses to therapy have been shown, in some cases, to predict treatment outcome. We show in lymphoma-bearing mice injected intravenously with hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate that the lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed flux of (13)C label between the carboxyl groups of pyruvate and lactate in the tumor can be measured using (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging, and that this flux is inhibited within 24 h of chemotherapy. The reduction in the measured flux after drug treatment and the induction of tumor cell death can be explained by loss of the coenzyme NAD(H) and decreases in concentrations of lactate and enzyme in the tumors. The technique could provide a new way to assess tumor responses to treatment in the clinic.

Title: Primary granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system: findings of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging prior to surgery. Case report.
Abstract: Primary granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system (CNS) is extremely rare. Its preoperative diagnosis is difficult as the condition displays nonspecific features on routine neuroimaging investigations. In this paper, the authors report findings of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and fractional anisotropy (FA) with diffusion tensor MR imaging in a case of granulomatous angiitis of the CNS. A 30-year-old man presented with morning headaches and grand mal seizures. An MR image revealed a mass resembling glioblastoma in the right temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a high choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratio indicative of a malignant neoplasm, accompanied by a slight elevation of glutamate and glutamine. The FA value was very low, which is inconsistent with malignant glioma. The mass was totally removed surgically. Histologically, the peripheral lesion of the mass consisted of a rough accumulation of fat granule cells, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and distribution of capillary vessels. Some vessels within the lesion were replaced by granulomas. The histological diagnosis was granulomatous angiitis of the CNS. The MIB-1-positive rate of the granuloma was approximately 5%. Both MR spectroscopy and FA were unable to accurately diagnose granulomatous angiitis of the CNS prior to surgery; however, elevated Cho/Cr and glutamate and glutamine shown by MR spectroscopy may indicate the moderate proliferation potential of the granuloma and the inflammatory process, respectively, in this condition. Although the low FA value in the present case enabled the authors to rule out a diagnosis of glioblastoma, FA values in inflammatory lesions require careful interpretation.

Title: Potential value of MR spectroscopic imaging for the radiosurgical management of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that metabolic information provided by 3D Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) could affect the definition of target volumes for radiation treatments (RT). This study aimed to (i) investigate the effect of incorporating spectroscopic volumes as determined by MRSI on target volume definition, patient selection eligibility, and dose prescription for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment planning; (ii) correlate the spatial extent of pre-SRS spectroscopic abnormality and treatment volumes with areas of focal recurrence as defined by changes in contrast enhancement; and (iii) examine the metabolic changes following SRS to assess treatment response. Twenty-six patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent both MRI and MRSI studies prior to SRS. Follow-up MRI exams were available for all 26 patients, with MRI/MRSI available in only 15/26 patients. We observed that the initial CNI 2 contours extended beyond the pre-SRS CE in 25/26 patients ranging in volume from 0.8 cc to 18.8 cc (median 5.6 cc). The inclusion of the volume of CNI 2 extending beyond the CE would have increased the SRS target volume by 5-165% (median 23.4%). This would have necessitated decreasing the SRS prescription dose in 19/26 patients to avoid increased toxicity; the resultant treatment volume would have exceeded 20cc in five patients, thus possibly excluding those from RS treatment per our institutional practice. MRSI follow-up studies showed a decrease in Choline, stable Creatine, and increased NAA indicative of response to SRS in the majority of patients. When combined with patient survival data, metabolic information obtained during follow-up MRSI studies seemed to indicate the potential to help to distinguish necrosis from new/recurrent tumor; however, this should be further verified by biopsy studies.

Title: Selective high-affinity ligand antibody mimics for cancer diagnosis and therapy: initial application to lymphoma/leukemia.
Abstract: PURPOSE: More than two decades of research and clinical trials have shown radioimmunotherapy to be a promising approach for treating various forms of cancer. Lym-1 antibody, which binds selectively to HLA-DR10 on malignant B-cell lymphocytes, has proved to be effective in delivering radionuclides to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Using a new approach to create small synthetic molecules that mimic the targeting properties of the Lym-1 antibody, a prototype, selective high-affinity ligand (SHAL), has been developed to bind to a unique region located within the Lym-1 epitope on HLA-DR10. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Computer docking methods were used to predict two sets of small molecules that bind to neighboring cavities on the beta subunit of HLA-DR10 surrounding a critical amino acid in the epitope, and the ligands were confirmed to bind to the protein by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Pairs of these molecules were then chemically linked together to produce a series of bidentate and bisbidentate SHALs. RESULTS: These SHALs bind with nanomolar to picomolar K(d)'s only to cell lines expressing HLA-DR10. Analyses of biopsy sections obtained from patients also confirmed that SHAL bound to both small and large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas mimicking the selectivity of Lym-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that synthetic molecules less than 1/50th the mass of an antibody can be designed to exhibit strong binding to subtle structural features on cell surface proteins similar to those recognized by antibodies. This approach offers great potential for developing small molecule therapeutics that target other types of cancer and disease.

Title: Monovoxel 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the progression of gliomas.
Abstract: AIM: Can monovoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reliably follow tumour progression in low-grade glioma? MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 patients with low-grade glioma underwent at least 3 MRS. RESULTS: For progression from a grade II to grade III tumour, a sensitivity of 57.1% and specificity of 60% were observed, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.8% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 54.5%. For progression under treatment, we obtained a sensitivity of 57.1% by N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) and myoinositol/creatine (Cr) and a specificity of 100% by Cho/Cr and lipids, with a PPV of 80% and a NPV of 63.6%. CONCLUSION: We found that NAA/Cho is the best marker of tumour progression before therapy, with a sensitivity of 53.9%. For the therapeutic response, sensitivity was only 28.2%.

Title: Brain lymphoma: usefulness of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: The diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) should always be considered as an emergency because of the therapeutic consequences it implies. In immunocompetent patients, it relies on stereotactic biopsy. Unfortunately, clinical and radiological features may be misleading and delay the diagnostic procedure. The case we report here illustrates the contribution of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the diagnostic approach of a very atypical PCNSL.

Title: Patterns of recurrence analysis in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme after three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with respect to pre-radiation therapy magnetic resonance spectroscopic findings.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether the combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) before radiation therapy (RT) is valuable for RT target definition, and to evaluate the feasibility of replacing the current definition of uniform margins by custom-shaped margins based on the information from MRI and MRSI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 23 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients underwent MRI and MRSI within 4 weeks after surgery but before the initiation of RT and at 2-month follow-up intervals thereafter. The MRSI data were quantified on the basis of a Choline-to-NAA Index (CNI) as a measure of spectroscopic abnormality. A combined anatomic and metabolic region of interest (MRI/S) consisting of T2-weighted hyperintensity, contrast enhancement (CE), resection cavity, and CNI2 (CNI >or= 2) based on the pre-RT imaging was compared to the extent of CNI2 and the RT dose distribution. The spatial relationship of the pre-RT MRI/S and the RT dose volume was compared with the extent of CE at each follow-up. RESULTS: Nine patients showed new or increased CE during follow-up, and 14 patients were either stable or had decreased CE. New or increased areas of CE occurred within CNI2 that was covered by 60 Gy in 6 patients and within the CNI2 that was not entirely covered by 60 Gy in 3 patients. New or increased CE resided within the pre-RT MRI/S lesion in 89% (8/9) of the patients with new or increased CE. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the definition of RT target volumes according to the combined morphologic and metabolic abnormality may be sufficient for RT targeting.

Title: MR spectroscopy in patients with intracranial meningiomas.
Abstract: With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we tried to get more pre-operative information in patients with suspicious meningioma concerning the histologic diagnosis especially regarding WHO Grades I and II meningiomas. Apart from the known spectra and metabolites such as choline, creatine and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), recent publications have shown that lactate is often found in necrotic tumor tissue. Within a 2 year period, 39 patients with an intracranial meningioma were studied with MRS. In 62.5% of histologic atypical meningiomas (WHO Grade II), a lactate peak could be demonstrated in the pre-operative MRS. Interestingly, also patients with multiple meningiomas show different spectra of their tumors.

Title: Distinction between recurrent glioma and radiation injury using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with diffusion-weighted imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the diagnostic effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy with diffusion-weighted imaging on the evaluation of the recurrent contrast-enhancing areas at the site of treated gliomas. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 55 patients who had new contrast-enhancing lesions in the vicinity of the previously resected and irradiated high-grade gliomas, two-dimensional MR spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging were performed. Spectral data for N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), lipid (Lip), and lactate (Lac) were analyzed in conjunction with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in all patients. Diagnosis of these lesions was assigned by means of follow-up or histopathology. RESULTS: The Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr ratios were significantly higher in recurrent tumor than in regions of radiation injury (p < 0.01). The ADC value and ADC ratios (ADC of contrast-enhancing lesion to matching structure in the contralateral hemisphere) were significantly higher in radiation injury regions than in recurrent tumor (p < 0.01). With MR spectroscopic data, two variables (Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr ratios) were shown to differentiate recurrent glioma from radiation injury, and 85.5% of total subjects were correctly classified into groups. However, with discriminant analysis of MR spectroscopy imaging plus diffusion-weighted imaging, three variables (Cho/NAA, Cho/Cr, and ADC ratio) were identified and 96.4% of total subjects were correctly classified. There was a significant difference between the diagnostic accuracy of the two discriminant analyses (Chi-square = 3.96, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Using discriminant analysis, this study found that MR spectroscopy in combination with ADC ratio, rather than ADC value, can improve the ability to differentiate recurrent glioma and radiation injury.

Title: Metabolic remodeling of malignant gliomas for enhanced sensitization during radiotherapy: an in vitro study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate a novel method to enhance radiosensitivity of gliomas via modification of metabolite flux immediately before radiotherapy. Malignant gliomas are highly glycolytic and produce copious amounts of lactic acid, which is effluxed to the tumor microenvironment via lactate transporters. We hypothesized that inhibition of lactic acid efflux would alter glioma metabolite profiles, including those that are radioprotective. H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify key metabolites, including those most effective for induction of low-dose radiation-induced cell death. METHODS: We inhibited lactate transport in U87-MG gliomas with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ACCA). Flow cytometry was used to assess induction of cell death in treated cells. Cells were analyzed by MRS after ACCA treatment. Control and treated cells were subjected to low-dose irradiation, and the surviving fractions of cells were determined by clonogenic assays. RESULTS: MRS revealed changes to intracellular lactate on treatment with ACCA. Significant decreases in the metabolites taurine, glutamate, glutathione, alanine, and glycine were observed, along with inversion of the choline/phosphocholine profile. On exposure to low-dose radiation, ACCA-pretreated U-87MG cells underwent rapid morphological changes, which were followed by apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of lactate efflux in malignant gliomas results in alterations of glycolytic metabolism, including decreased levels of the antioxidants taurine and glutathione and enhanced radiosensitivity of ACCA-treated cells. Thus, in situ application of lactate transport inhibitors such as ACCA as a novel adjunctive therapeutic strategy against glial tumors may greatly enhance the level of radiation-induced cell killing during a combined radio- and chemotherapeutic regimen.

Title: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor and oligodendroglioma: the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Case report and review of the literature.
Abstract: Preoperative differentiation between dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) and low-grade glioma is often not possible. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor is a recently described entity of uncertain origin; however, the diagnosis has important clinical implications. Clinical and radiological findings of DNT and low-grade glioma, especially oligodendroglioma, may be similar. Treatment options and prognosis differ significantly between these two lesions; consequently, accurate diagnosis is imperative. The authors describe two individuals who presented simultaneously at their institution: one patient with an oligodendroglioma and a second patient with DNT. The natural history, neurodiagnostic, and pathological features of each are reviewed with special emphasis on the potential utility of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in differentiating these lesions.

Title: Extra-axial cavernous hemangioma: two case reports.
Abstract: Two patients with extra-axial cavernous hemangioma who presented with headache and oculovisual disturbances were investigated with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The lesions masqueraded as basal meningioma, but this diagnosis was not supported by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in one patient. Cerebral angiography with embolization was indicated in one patient, but embolization was not justified in the other. Both patients underwent a pterional craniotomy. The lesions were extradural and highly vascular, necessitating excessive transfusion in one patient in whom gross total resection was achieved, and precluding satisfactory removal in the other. There was no mortality. Transient ophthalmoplegia, the only complication in one patient, was due to surgical manipulation of the cavernous sinus; it resolved progressively over 3 months. Extra-axial skull base cavernous hemangiomas are distinct entities with clinical and radiological characteristics that differ from those of intraparenchymal cavernous malformations. They can mimic meningiomas or pituitary tumors. In some cases, magnetic resonance spectroscopy may narrow the differential diagnoses. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice, facilitated by preoperative embolization to reduce intraoperative bleeding and by the application of the principles of skull base surgery. Fractionated radiotherapy is an alternative in partial or difficult resections and in high-risk and elderly patients.

Title: Choline transporter as a novel target for molecular imaging of cancer.
Abstract: Abnormalities of choline processing in cancer cells have been used as a basis for imaging of cancer with positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In this study, the transport mechanism for choline was investigated in cultured PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, tritiated hemicholinium 3 (HC-3), a well-known inhibitor of choline transport, was studied as a prototypic molecular imaging probe in PC-3 cells and 9L glioma-bearing rats. [(3)H]Choline uptake by PC-3 cells was found to have both facilitative and nonfacilitative components. Facilitative transport was characterized by partial sodium dependence and intermediate affinity (K(M) = 9.7 +/- 0.8 microM). HC-3 inhibited choline with a K(I) of 10.5+/- 2.2 microM. Ouabain (1 mM) caused a 94% reduction in choline uptake. At physiologic choline concentration, phosphocholine was the rapid and predominant metabolic fate. The binding of [(3)H]HC-3 to PC-3 cells was rapid and specific (competitively blocked with unlabeled HC-3). Biodistribution of [(3)H]HC-3 in 9L glioma-bearing rats showed the ranking of uptake to be kidney > lung > tumor > liver > skeletal muscle congruent with blood > brain. In comparison with [(14)C]choline, [(3)H]HC-3 showed over twofold higher tumor uptake and favorable uptake ratios of tumor to blood, tumor to muscle, tumor to lung, and tumor to liver. The data demonstrate the quantitative importance of an intermediate-affinity, partially sodium-dependent choline transport system on choline processing in PC-3 cancer cells. The biodistribution properties of [(3)H]HC-3 in tumor-bearing rats encourage the development of molecular imaging probes based on choline transporter binding ligands.

Title: Prognostic significance of serial magnetic resonance spectroscopies over the course of radiation therapy for patients with malignant glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of high grade gliomas (HGG) involves maximal neuro-surgical debulking, followed by post-operative radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, depending on histologic grade. Despite this aggressive strategy, there are few long-term survivors. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging method that can monitor metabolic changes in brain tumours. To date there is little data concerning the prognostic significance of the evolving spectral alterations during a course of radiotherapy. MATERIALS: We report herein a prospective study of patients with HGGs undergoing post-operative radiotherapy. Fourteen consecutively eligible patients with a confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant glioma and completion of all required MRS imaging were included in this study. All patients had MRS imaging prior to radiotherapy, at week 4 of radiotherapy, and 2 months post-treatment. T1 and T2 weighted images as well as post-gadolinium multi-voxel proton MRS images were obtained. Normalized (tumour metabolite/normal brain metabolite) levels of choline, NAA, creatine, lipid and lactate were calculated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of progression-free and overall survival were constructed based on the evolving patterns of metabolite changes over the course of the images. RESULTS: The mean tumour choline/NAA ratio decreased over the course of therapy, with a reduction observed between the baseline and post-radiotherapy studies (1.91 vs. 1.29, P=0.049). A similar decrease was identified with the mean normalized choline ratio, with a highly significant difference observed between the baseline and post-radiation images (1.61 vs. 0.96, P=0.001). Patients who exhibited more than 40% decrease in normalized choline between the week 4 and post-radiotherapy studies were associated with unfavourable survival (logrank test, P=0.003) and disease progression (logrank test, P=0.012). The Lactate/NAA ratio at the 4th week of radiotherapy and the change in normalized choline/creatine between baseline and week 4 of radiotherapy were also predictive of outcome suggesting the possibility of adaptive, response-based radiation treatment. Patients with two or more poor prognostic MRS indices had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with zero or one poor indices, with 15% and 68% at 1 year, respectively (logrank test, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The evolving pattern of spectral changes over the course of radiotherapy, in particular those associated with choline-containing compounds, appears to be prognostic of tumour response and outcome. Based on our data, a decision point may exist in the mid course of radical radiotherapy, at which time consideration of the choline levels could indicate the extent of radiotherapeutic response, thus allowing for individualized treatment modification.

Title: Utilization of glutamate/creatine ratios for proton spectroscopic diagnosis of meningiomas.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to determine the potential of metabolites other than alanine to diagnose intracranial meningiomas on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). METHODS: Using a 1.5-T MR system the lesions were initially identified on FLAIR, and T1- and T2-weighted images. Employing standard point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) for single voxel proton MRS (TR 1500 ms, TE 30 ms, 128 acquisitions, voxel size 2 x 2 x 2 cm, acquisition time 3.12 min), MR spectra were obtained from 5 patients with meningiomas, from 20 with other intracranial lesions, and from 4 normal controls. Peak heights of nine resonances, including lipid, lactate, alanine, NAA (N-acetylaspartate), beta/gamma-Glx (glutamate + glutamine), creatine, choline, myo-inositol, and alpha-Glx/glutathione, were measured in all spectra. The relative quantity of each metabolite was measured as the ratio of its peak height to the peak height of creatine. RESULTS: Relative quantities of alpha-Glx/glutathione, beta/gamma-Glx, and total Glx/glutathione were significantly elevated in meningiomas compared to the 20 other intracranial lesions and the normal control brains. Alanine was found in four of five meningiomas, but lactate partially masked the alanine in three meningiomas. None of the other lesions or control brains showed an alanine peak. The one meningioma with no alanine and the three others with lactate had elevated Glx. CONCLUSION: While alanine is a relatively unique marker for meningioma, our results support the hypothesis that the combination of glutamate/creatine ratios and alanine on proton MRS is more specific and reliable for the diagnosis of meningiomas than alanine alone.

Title: Magnetic resonance investigation of bone marrow following priming and stem cell mobilization.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate application of MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor bone marrow cellularity during pretransplant priming with chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 lymphoma and myeloma patients, in remission following induction therapy and considered eligible for high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, were included in the study. MR investigation was scheduled four times: at study entry, and one, two, and four weeks following priming. Priming with cyclophosphamide and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) started the day after study entry. MR parameters studied in a region of interest were as follows: bone marrow intensity on short-time inversion-recovery (STIR) turbo spin-echo (TSE; thus STIRTSE) and on T1-weighted TSE (T1TSE) images, T2 value for fat component, T2 value for water component, water/fat ratio (W/F), T1 value for fat component, and T1 value for water component. RESULTS: The results did not support the hypothesis that hematopoietic expansion quantitated and monitored by MR correlates to the level of mobilized progenitor cells. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that release of stem cells is a more complex phenomenon than hematopoietic expansion and reduction of fat tissue in bone marrow.

Title: Primary brain T-cell lymphoma after kidney transplantation: a case report.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Development of primary brain PTLD after kidney transplantation is uncommon, and the incidence of T-cell phenotypes is much more rarely reported in the previous literature. However, prognosis of T-cell PTLD is typically grave, so early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to patient survival. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old woman, who had received a kidney transplant 4 years previously, presented with focal seizures and left hemiparesis. She underwent serial diagnostic neuroimaging, which revealed an undefined etiology of an intracerebral tumor. Pathologic biopsy was mandatory. The tumor was grossly removed and its pathology was determined to be monomorphic T-cell lymphoma. No other organ involvement was noted. The patient underwent chemotherapy with a combination of carmustine, oncovin, and methylprednisolone. The patient's neurologic signs, however, deteriorated rapidly, and the patient finally died of neutropenia and septic shock 1 month after chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Development of primary brain T-cell PTLD after kidney transplantation is rare and typically has a grave prognosis, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of lymphoma can only be confirmed by pathologic biopsy; however, magnetic resonance imaging, in particular magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is a powerful tool for differential diagnosis.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in childhood brainstem lesions.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of brainstem lesions in children based on magnetic resonance imaging alone is a challenging problem. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive technique for spatial characterization of biochemical markers in tissues and gives information regarding cell membrane proliferation, neuronal damage, and energy metabolism. METHODS: We measured the concentrations of biochemical markers in five children with brainstem lesions and evaluated their potential diagnostic significance. Images and spectra were acquired on a 1.5-T imager. The concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, tetramethylamines (e.g., choline), creatine, phosphocreatine, lactate, and lipids were measured within lesions located at the brainstem using Point-resolved spectroscopy sequences. RESULTS: Diagnosis based on localized proton spectroscopy included brainstem glioma, brainstem encephalitis, demyelination, dysmyelination secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), and possible infection or radiation necrosis. In all but one patient, diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy or by clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This small sample of patients suggests that MRS is important in the differential diagnosis between proliferative and nonproliferative lesions in patients without neurofibromatosis. Unfortunately, in cases of NF 1, MRS can have a rather misdiagnosis role.

Title: Single voxel proton MR spectroscopy findings of typical and atypical intracranial meningiomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To prospectively define proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings of meningiomas, and describe the ability or inability of short- and long-echo MRS to differentiate typical and atypical meningiomas in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with pathologically confirmed typical meningiomas and six with atypical meningiomas were evaluated with conventional MR imaging and MRS before resection. MRS studies using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) localisation, at short- and long-echo time (TR 2000 ms, TE: 30 and 144 ms, 64-96 acquisition) were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner. MRS data obtained from these patients were compared with histopathological findings. Mean cellular proliferation (MIB-1) antibody staining against the Ki-67 antigen was also determined in all meningiomas. RESULTS: Prominent choline (Cho) was present in all meningiomas. Alanine (Ala) was observed in 21 cases of the 23 meningiomas. Acetylaspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cr) were either not observed or detected in minimal amounts in at all both groups of meningiomas on long TE (144 ms) spectra. The mean Cho/Cr values in the four atypical meningiomas were 4.44+/-0.30 (mean+/-standard deviation) and 3.39+/-0.52 in the 12 typical meningiomas on short TE spectra. Cho/Cr ratio could not be determined in the other seven cases because of a lack of creatine peak. Of the five meningiomas in which a lactate peak was detected, four were in typical cases and only one was in atypical meningioma. Mean MIB-1 proliferation index was 3.7% in typical meningiomas and 10% in atypical meningiomas. CONCLUSION: Prominent Cho, absence or low amount of NAA and Cr, and presence of Ala were common characteristics of spectral pattern of both atypical and typical meningiomas on MRS. MRS cannot reliably differentiate typical intracranial meningiomas from atypical meningiomas preoperatively. Mean MIB-1 proliferation index was well correlated with histopathology findings.

Title: Diagnostic performance of spectroscopic and perfusion MRI for distinction of brain tumors.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of spectroscopic and perfusion MRI for glioma grading and for distinguishing glioblastomas from metastases and from CNS lymphomas. METHODS: The authors examined 79 consecutive patients with first detection of a brain neoplasm on nonenhanced CT scans and no therapy prior to evaluation. Spectroscopic MRI; arterial spin-labeling MRI for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF); first-pass dynamic, susceptibility-weighted, contrast-enhanced MRI for measuring cerebral blood volume; and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed, and optimum thresholds for tumor classification and glioma grading were determined. RESULTS: Perfusion MRI had a higher diagnostic performance than spectroscopic MRI. Because of a significantly higher tumor blood flow in glioblastomas compared with CNS lymphomas, a threshold value of 1.2 for CBF provided sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 80%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 94%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89%. Because CBF was significantly higher in peritumoral nonenhancing T2-hyperintense regions of glioblastomas compared with metastases, a threshold value of 0.5 for CBF provided sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 100%, 71%, 94%, and 100%. Glioblastomas had the highest tumor blood flow values among all other glioma grades. For discrimination of glioblastomas from grade 3 gliomas, sensitivity was 97%, specificity was 50%, PPV was 84%, and NPV was 86% (CBF threshold value of 1.4), and for discrimination of glioblastomas from grade 2 gliomas, sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 78%, PPV was 94%, and NPV was 78% (CBF threshold value of 1.6). CONCLUSION: Perfusion MRI is predictive in distinguishing glioblastomas from metastases, CNS lymphomas and other gliomas vs MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Title: Identification of diffuse and focal brain lesions by clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the comparison of magnetic resonance (MR) spectra acquired from unknown brain lesions with published spectra in order to help identify unknown lesions in clinical settings. The paper includes lists of references for published MR spectra of various brain diseases, including pyogenic abscesses, encephalitis (herpes simplex, Rasmussen's and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), neurocysticercosis, tuberculoma, cysts (arachnoid, epidermoid and hydatid), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), Alexander disease, Canavan's disease, Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy), Leigh's disease, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with cysts, metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Zellweger syndrome, HIV-associated lesions [cryptococcus, lymphoma, toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)], hydrocephalus and tuberous sclerosis. Each list includes information on the echo time(s) (TE) of the published spectra, whether a control spectrum is shown, whether the corresponding image and voxel position are shown and the patient ages if known. The references are listed in the approximate order of usefulness, based on spectral quality, number of spectra, range of echo times and whether the voxel positions are shown. Spectra of Zellweger syndrome, cryptococcal infection, toxoplasmosis and lymphoma are included, along with a spectrum showing propanediol (propylene glycol).

Title: Contribution of NMR spectroscopy to the differential diagnosis of a recurrent cranial mass 7 years after irradiation for a pediatric ependymoma.
Abstract: CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 5-year-old-boy who underwent surgery and focal radiotherapy for an anaplastic ependymoma of the fourth ventricle. One year later, a spinal metastasis was treated the same way. Six years later, a 16-mm lesion was found on a control MRI in the posterior fossa. To help the differential diagnosis between a relapse, a radio-induced modification, and a new tumor, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed. The main findings were a peak at the expected resonance frequency of reduced glutathione, a prominent peak of glutamate/glutamine compounds, a low N-acetylaspartate, and the absence of elevated choline. These findings were suggestive of a meningioma, although the latency between irradiation and development of the lesion was quite short. The diagnosis was confirmed by the pathological examination. CONCLUSION: This case exemplifies the fact that magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides useful biochemical information in such a clinical setting.

Title: Contrast/Noise ratio on conventional MRI and choline/creatine ratio on proton MRI spectroscopy accurately discriminate low-grade from high-grade cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Histopathology is the gold standard to establish the grade of brain tumors but biopsy and/or surgery are not always possible. The aim of this study is to determine whether histological grade of tumors may be predicted by means of conventional gadolinium-enhanced MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we included 35 consecutive patients with single brain tumors and final histopathological verification: 12 had low-grade glioma, 16 had high-grade glioma, and 7 had single metastasis. Initially, we carried out T1 and T2 MRI paying attention to the following features: border definition, mass effect, heterogeneity of signal, perilesional edeme, hemorrhage, necrosis, and corpus callosum invasion. Gadolinium-enhancement was evaluated with the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Next, single-voxel proton MRS was carried out to measure the absolute values of metabolites (N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine, choline, and myo-inositol) and their ratios in the area of maximum contrast enhancement. RESULTS: We found that gadolinium-enhancement measured with the CNR (CNR > 35.86) predicted malignancy at 82.6% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.97). With regard to MRS a choline/creatine ratio higher than 1.56 predicted malignancy at 88.9% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity (area under the curve, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99). When we combined the CNR value, the choline/creatine ratio, and the presence of lactates in a model of discriminant analysis the predictive power improved significantly with an area under the curve of 0.99% (95% CI, 0.87-1). However, the used techniques were unable to distinguish metastases from high-grade gliomas accurately. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of contrast enhancement measured with the CNR, the choline/creatine ratio, and the presence of lactate were the most powerful variables to predict malignancy in brain tumors. The CNR is a simple, objective, and useful tool in the initial assessment of gliomas and metastases.

Title: Very late frontal relapse of medulloblastoma mimicking a meningioma in an adult: usefulness of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging for preoperative diagnosis: case report.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We present a rare case of very long-term medulloblastoma relapse in an adult patient and discuss the pattern of recurrence and metabolic imaging of the tumor. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a frontobasal midline tumor 21 years after treatment of a cerebellar medulloblastoma by surgery followed by chemotherapy and craniospinal radiotherapy. Magnetic resonance images were suggestive of a meningioma. Several hypotheses were discussed, such as other radio-induced tumors, sarcomas, high-grade gliomas, or lymphomas (previous chemotherapy) and even recurrence of medulloblastoma. Preoperative exploration included H magnetic resonance single-voxel spectroscopy (35 and 135 ms echo time), diffusion imaging, and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTION: On magnetic resonance spectroscopy, N-acetyl-aspartate and an elevated choline/creatine ratio were retrieved, with a huge unidentified peak at 1.27 parts per million (ppm). Myoinositol signal was present at both echo times. On diffusion imaging, the tumor appeared hyperintense, with a low apparent diffusion coefficient value of 0.689. In the perfusion study, the maximal relative cerebral blood volume was 2. Metabolic imaging favored the diagnosis of medulloblastoma over the initially suspected diagnosis of meningioma. The patient underwent complete removal of the tumor that was confirmed to be a metastasis of his primary medulloblastoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and complementary courses of radiotherapy and chemotherapy were planned. CONCLUSION: Late relapse should be considered, even after several decades, on occurrence of a second intracranial tumor in this context. Our observation validates the clinical interest of preoperative metabolic imaging for brain tumors with distinctive pattern.

Title: Incidence and patterns of neuraxis metastases in children with diffuse pontine glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We performed a retrospective study of patients with diffuse pontine glioma (DPG) who suffered neuraxis metastasis (NM) and characterized the incidence, clinical features, radiologic findings, and patterns of disease dissemination. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and spine was used to assess NM. Some patients also underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (6 patients) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans (13 patients) to further evaluate areas of metastatic disease. Three patients had histologic confirmation of disease at the site of NM. RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2003, 18 of 96 patients (17.3%) with DPG developed NM. The median age at diagnosis was 8 years (range, 4-17). All patients had adjuvant chemotherapy and/or focal radiotherapy at diagnosis. The NM occurred at a median of 15 months from diagnosis of DPG (range, 3-96). Three patterns of NM were seen on MRI of brain and spine in these patients; 8 (39%) had parenchymal (PM), 4 (22%) leptomeningeal (PM), 2 (11%) subependymal, and in 5 a combination of two or more patterns. The MRS and FDG-PET scan of suspected areas of metastatic disease was consistent with tumor in 6 of 6 and 12 of 13 patients who underwent these procedures respectively. Three patients also had histologic confirmation of malignant glioma at the site of NM. Despite salvage therapy, all 18 patients have died of disease at a median of 5 months (range, 0.5-20) from diagnosis of neuraxis spread. CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the need for screening patients with DPG for NM at the time of recurrence.

Title: Association of 99mTc-MIBI brain SPECT and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to assess glioma recurrence after radiotherapy.
Abstract: AIM: The aim of this study was to compare 99mTc-MIBI brain SPECT and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) findings and to evaluate their association. METHODS: Both exams were performed on 30 glioma patients, previously operated and treated with radiotherapy, having MRI doubtful between recurrence and radiotherapy effects. SPECT images were acquired 15 minutes after radiopharmaceutical administration with a dual-head gamma camera. T1/B1 uptake ratio was calculated between a tumor ROI (T1) and a normal mirror symmetric ROI (B1) and T2/B2 ratio was obtained between a ROI in the hottest neoplastic part (T2) and a normal mirror symmetric ROI (B2). 1H-MRS was performed using a 1.5 T system equipped with a spectroscopy package. SPECT and 1H-MRS data were compared with histology after new surgery or with follow-up. RESULTS: SPECT and 1H-MRS showed recurrence in 18 patients (confirmed by biopsy, coinciding only in 17 cases) and were negative in 10 (1 false negative). SPECT and 1H-MRS disagreed in 2 cases of recurrence (1 diagnosed by brain SPECT, 1 by 1H-MRS). T1/B1 ratio mean value (4.26+/-2.5) was significantly lower than T2/B2 (4.93+/-2.81; P<0.001). SPECT and 1H-MRS sensitivity in detecting recurrence was 90%, specificity 100%, accuracy 93%, negative predictive value (NPV) 83% and positive predictive value (PPV) 100%; the associated exams sensitivity was 95%, specificity 100%, accuracy 96.6%, NPV 90.9%, PPV 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Brain SPECT and 1H-MRS have equivalent values of diagnostic parameters in differentiating tumor recurrence and radiation effects, and their association might provide additional information.

Title: Diagnosis and treatment of recurrent high-grade astrocytoma.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas represent a significant source of cancer-related death, and usually recur despite treatment. In this analysis of current brain tumor medicine, we review diagnosis, standard treatment, and emerging therapies for recurrent astrocytomas. Difficulties in interpreting radiographic evidence, especially with regard to differentiating between tumor and necrosis, present a formidable challenge. The most accurate diagnoses come from tissue confirmation of recurrent tumor, but a combination of imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, may also be relevant for diagnosis. Repeat resection can prolong life, but repeat irradiation of the brain poses serious risks and results in necrosis of healthy brain tissue; therefore, reirradiation is usually not offered to patients with recurrent tumors. We describe the use of conventional radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy, radiosurgery, and photodynamic therapy for recurrent high-grade glioma. The use of chemotherapy is limited by drug distribution and toxicity, but the development of new drug-delivery techniques such as convection-enhanced delivery, which delivers therapeutic molecules at an effective concentration directly to the brain, may provide a way to reduce systemic exposure to cytotoxic agents. We also discuss targeted therapies designed to inhibit aberrant cell-signaling pathways, as well as new experimental therapies such as immunotherapy. The treatment of this devastating disease has so far been met with limited success, but emerging knowledge of neuroscience and the development of novel therapeutic agents will likely give patients new options and require the neuro-oncology community to redefine clinical trial design and strategy continually.

Title: Bilateral optic pathway glioma with intracranial calcification: magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings.
Abstract: Optic nerve glioma is the most common primary neoplasm of the optic nerve in childhood. It can extend intracranially along the optic pathway (optic pathway glioma). The lesion tends to present with decreased visual acuity in the affected eye, but can cause additional symptoms when it is large. Local involvement within the orbit can be characterized using CT, but MRI is superior in showing the intracranial extent of the lesion. Intracranial calcification in optic pathway glioma is rare. We present a rare case of optic pathway glioma with calcification in the intracranial component. Also, we describe MR spectroscopy (MRS) findings in this case.

Title: In vitro study of astrocytic tumour metabolism by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of glial brain tumours reported that higher grade of astrocytoma is associated with increased level of choline-containing compounds (Cho) and decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr). In this work, we studied the metabolism of glioma tumours by in vitro proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). 1H-MR spectra were recorded in vitro from perchloric acid extracts of astrocytoma (WHO II) and glioblastoma multiforme (WHO IV) samples. We observed differences between astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme in the levels of Cho, alanine, lactate, NAA, and glutamate/glutamine. In astrocytoma samples, we found higher MR signal of NAA and lower signal of Cho and alanine. MR spectra of glioblastoma samples reported significantly higher levels of lactate and glutamate/glutamine. In contrast, levels of Cr were the same in both tumour types. We also determined NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios in the tumour samples. The NAA/Cr ratio was higher in astrocytomas than in glioblastomas multiforme. Conversely, the Cho/Cr ratio was higher in glioblastoma multiforme. The results indicate that MRS is a promising method for distinguishing pathologies in human brain and for pre-surgical grading of brain tumours.

Title: Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques to evaluate CNS glioma.
Abstract: To make full use of the benefits of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of intracranial glioma, a variety of advanced MRI and qualitative and quantitative techniques can be added to the radiologists' diagnostic armamentarium, beyond the standard contrast-enhanced images. These techniques include perfusion MRI, which is useful in the characterization of glioma because a relative quantification of cerebral microcirculatory parameters may be estimated; magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can provide an estimate of the concentration of normal and abnormal metabolites in the brain and, when supplemented with magnetic resonance perfusion data, can be a useful tool for distinguishing between tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis; and diffusion tensor imaging, which combines physiologic behaviors unique to the cytoarchitecture of brain cells and the interstitial tissues with 2D and 3D anatomic magnetic resonance images, and thereby differentiates intact white matter tracts, displaced by tumor or surrounding edema, from invasion or disruption by a more aggressive neoplasm.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of normal human brain and glioma: a quantitative in vivo study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a noninvasive method of examining a wide variety of cerebral metabolites in both healthy subjects and patients with various brain diseases. Absolute metabolite concentrations have been determined using external and internal standards with known concentrations. When an external standard is placed beside the head, variations in signal amplitudes due to B1 field inhomogeneity and static field inhomogeneity may occur. Hence an internal standard is preferable. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively analyze the metabolite concentrations in normal adult brains and gliomas by in vivo proton MRS using the fully relaxed water signal as an internal standard. METHODS: Between January 1998 and October 2001, 28 healthy volunteers and 16 patients with gliomas were examined by in vivo proton MRS. Single-voxel spectra were acquired using the point-resolved spectroscopic pulse sequence with a 1.5 T scanner (TR/TE/Ave = 3000 ms/30 ms/64). RESULTS: The calculated concentrations of N-acetyl-asparatate (NAA), creatine (Cre), choline (Cho), and water (H2O) in the normal hemispheric white matter were (23.59 +/- 2.62) mmol/L, (13.06 +/- 1.8) mmol/L, (4.28 +/- 0.8) mmol/L, and (47,280.96 +/- 5414.85) mmol/L, respectively. The metabolite concentrations were not necessarily uniform in different parts of the brain. The concentrations of NAA and Cre decreased in all gliomas (P < 0.001). The ratios of NAA/Cho and NAA/H2O showed a significant difference between the normal brain and gliomas, and also between the high and low grades (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of in vivo proton MR spectra using the fully relaxed water signal as an internal standard is useful. The concentrations of NAA and the ratios of NAA/H2O and NAA/Cho conduce to discriminating between the glioma and normal brain, and also between the low-grade glioma and high-grade glioma.

Title: Comparing 0.2 tesla with 1.5 tesla intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging analysis of setup, workflow, and efficiency.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To compare low-field with high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in respect to setup, workflow, and efficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 750 patients were investigated either with a 0.2 T (March 1996-July 2001) or a 1.5 T (April 2002-August 2004) MRI system adapted for intraoperative use. RESULTS: With the low-field setup, 330 patients were examined in 65 months; with the high-field setup, 420 patients were examined in 29 months, which is a 2.8-fold increase in cases per month (14.5 versus 5.1) reflecting improved ease of use. Concerning intraoperative workflow, the time for preparation to start intraoperative imaging decreased fivefold (2 minutes instead of 10 minutes); navigation was applied more often with 57% versus 51% (240/420 versus 167/330), whereas functional data were integrated in 35% versus 39% (84/240 versus 65/167). Application of navigation updates was doubled (22% versus 11%; 53/240 versus 18/167). Image acquisition time was reduced by a factor of two, allowing a more detailed imaging protocol, whereas the image quality is clearly improved in the high-field setup, where there was no difference between the standard preoperative image quality compared with the intraoperative quality. This contributed to an increased detection of tumor remnants and extended resections in pituitary (36% versus 29%; 47/129 versus 17/59) and glioma surgery (41% versus 26%; 38/93 versus 28/106). CONCLUSION: Compared with the low-field setup, the high-field setup results not only in clearly superior image quality and increased imaging armamentarium, contributing to increased rates of detected tumor remnants, but also in a distinct improvement of intraoperative workflow. Furthermore, intraoperative high-field MRI offers various modalities beyond standard anatomic imaging, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI.

Title: Correlation between choline and MIB-1 index in human gliomas. A quantitative in proton MR spectroscopy study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Choline (Cho) containing compounds are usually evaluated using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) by relative ratios such as Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and Cho/creatine (Cre) ratios. To clarify the significance of Cho level in gliomas, we evaluated the quantified Cho level using MRS and compared it with the proliferation activity as determined by MIB-1 immunoreactivity in the histological specimen. METHODS: There were seven benign and seven malignant gliomas. MRS was obtained using a single-voxel proton regional imaging of metabolites (PRIME) sequence with three different TE for T2 compensation. Quantified Cho level was compared with the number of MIB-1 immunopositive positive cells and cell density in surgical specimens. RESULT: A positive correlation was observed between Cho and MIB-1 in benign gliomas, whereas there was a trend to an inverse correlation in malignant gliomas. This inverse correlation became a positive correlation when the necrotic area of the tumor (on the T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced images) was excluded from the voxel of interest (VOI) for MRS, but this correlation did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The quantification data clarified the behavior of Cho in malignant gliomas. The quantification method has the advantage of limiting the influence of other metabolites on Cho determination. In particular, the levels of other commonly measured metabolites, including Cre, may also be altered in glioma, making ratios between metabolites misleading. Heterogeneity in the MRS VOI should be considered when evaluating the proliferative activity of malignant glioma by MRS.

Title: Imaging in neurooncology.
Abstract: Imaging in patients with brain tumors aims toward the determination of the localization, extend, type, and malignancy of the tumor. Imaging is being used for primary diagnosis, planning of treatment including placement of stereotaxic biopsy, resection, radiation, guided application of experimental therapeutics, and delineation of tumor from functionally important neuronal tissue. After treatment, imaging is being used to quantify the treatment response and the extent of residual tumor. At follow-up, imaging helps to determine tumor progression and to differentiate recurrent tumor growth from treatment-induced tissue changes, such as radiation necrosis. A variety of complementary imaging methods are currently being used to obtain all the information necessary to achieve the above mentioned goals. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal mostly anatomical information on the tumor, whereas magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) give important information on the metabolic state and molecular events within the tumor. Functional MRI and functional PET, in combination with electrophysiological methods like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being used to delineate functionally important neuronal tissue, which has to be preserved from treatment-induced damage, as well as to gather information on tumor-induced brain plasticity. In addition, optical imaging devices have been implemented in the past few years for the development of new therapeutics, especially in experimental glioma models. In summary, imaging in patients with brain tumors plays a central role in the management of the disease and in the development of improved imaging-guided therapies.

Title: Neuroimaging of infections.
Abstract: Neuroimaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and therapeutic decision making in infectious diseases of the nervous system. The review summarizes imaging findings and recent advances in the diagnosis of pyogenic brain abscess, ventriculitis, viral disease including exotic and emergent viruses, and opportunistic disease. For each condition, the ensuing therapeutic steps are presented. In cases of uncomplicated meningitis, cranial computed tomography (CT) appears to be sufficient for clinical management to exclude acute brain edema, hydrocephalus, and pathology of the base of skull. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior in depicting complications like sub-/epidural empyema and vasculitic complications notably on FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)-weighted images. The newer technique of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) shows early parenchymal complications of meningitis earlier and with more clarity and is of help in differentiation of pyogenic abscess (PA) from ring enhancing lesions of other etiology. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PMRS) seems to produce specific peak patterns in cases of abscess. The presence of lactate cytosolic amino acids and absence of choline seems to indicate PA. Also in cases of suspected opportunistic infection due to toxoplasma DWI may be of help in the differentiation from lymphoma, showing no restriction of water diffusion. In patients with herpes simplex and more exotic viruses like West Nile and Murray Valley virus DWI allows earlier lesion detection and therapeutic intervention with virustatic drugs.

Title: Identification of novel targeting peptides for human ovarian cancer cells using "one-bead one-compound" combinatorial libraries.
Abstract: Using "one-bead one-compound" combinatorial chemistry technology, we generated random peptide libraries containing millions of 90 mum TentaGel beads, each with its own unique amino acid sequence. A cyclic random 8-mer library was screened with CAOV-3 (a human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line) and beads with a unique ligand that bind to the cell surface receptors were coated by one or more layers of cells. These positive beads were isolated, stripped, and microsequenced. Several peptide motifs were identified from these screenings, some of which were novel and unique, e.g., cDGX(4)GX(6)X(7)c. Structure-activity relationship studies of this peptide revealed that the l-aspartate residue at position 2, the two glycines at positions 3 and 5, and the two d-cysteines at the amino and COOH terminus are critical for activity. In addition, a hydrophobic residue was preferred at position X(4), whereas amino acids at positions X(6) and X(7) were more variable. Binding of this peptide to a number of different cancer cell lines and normal cells was also determined and we observed that peptides with this motif bound preferentially to three other human ovarian cancer cell lines (ES-2, SKOV-3, and OVCAR-3) as well as a human glioblastoma cancer cell line (A172). Structural analysis of the peptides using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed strong conformational similarity among all peptides with cX(1)GX(4)GX(6)X(7)c motif. Blocking study with a panel of anti-integrin antibodies strongly suggests alpha3 integrin present on these ovarian adenocarcinoma cells is the target receptor for this peptide.

Title: [Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in gliomas].
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), that may be added to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam exhibit an increasing role in the management of brain tumors. These technique allow quantitative analysis of metabolites, either cell specific, either reflecting physiological and/or pathological process. With a rigorous approach, MRS explore brain metabolism that may improve MRI data in clinical practice in neuro-oncology. Positive diagnosis of brain tumor, differential diagnosis between infiltrative glioma (grade II) and gliomatosis, determination of the limits of tumor infiltration, and distinction between tumor and post-therapeutic images are some of the potential applications of MRS. Ongoing and future studies may also precise the place of MRS in the differential diagnosis between high grade glioma, metastasis and CNS lymphoma, as well as in monitoring therapy in glioma.

Title: Human cervical lymphadenopathy: evaluation with in vivo 1H-MRS at 1.5 T.
Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the feasibility of performing in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of cervical lymph nodes, and the clinical usefulness of the technique in the characterization of cervical lymphadenopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cervical lymphadenopathy was examined in 20 individuals with malignant disease, i.e. 10 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 6 with undifferentiated carcinoma (UDC) and 4 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Cervical lymphadenopathy was also examined in 4 individuals with benign disease, i.e. 3 with tuberculosis (TB) and 1 with Castleman's disease. A point-resolved spectroscopic sequence with echo times (TE) of 136 and 272 ms and a time-domain spectral fitting procedure were used to estimate peak amplitude of choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and unsuppressed water. Cho/Cr and Cho/water ratios were measured for each lesion. The mean ratio for each lesion group was obtained and results were compared statistically. RESULTS: At TE of 136 ms, spectra were interpretable in all 24 cases and a Cr peak was identified with post-processing in 15 cases. The Cho/Cr and Cho/water ratios for NHL were 9.1 +/- 5.2 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3), for UDC were 4.4 +/- 0.9 and 1.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3), and for SCC were 2.1 +/- 0.6 and 0.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3), respectively. Both Cho/Cr and Cho/water ratios for UDC were significantly higher than SCC (p = 0.002 and 0.026, respectively). At TE of 272 ms, spectra were interpretable in 22 of 24 cases and a Cr peak was identified with post-processing in 11 cases. Cho/Cr and Cho/water ratios for NHL were 5.4 and 4.6 +/- 1.4 x 10(-3), for UDC were 4.2 +/- 1.5 and 2.6 +/- 1.0 x 10(-3) and for SCC were 2.5 +/- 1.1 and 1.3 +/- 0.6 x 10(-3), respectively. The Cho/water ratio for UDC was significantly higher than for SCC (p = 0.04). The Cho/Cr ratio for UDC was also higher than for SCC, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Neither Cho nor Cr was detected in the 3 cases of TB. CONCLUSION: In vivo (1)H-MRS is a feasible technique for the evaluation of cervical lymph nodes and it offers potential as a clinical tool in the investigation of cervical lymphadenopathy. However, further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to validate the findings of this initial report.

Title: Minute glioma identified by 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy--case report.
Abstract: A 33-year-old man presented with a minute tumor incidentally detected by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging screening. 1.5 Tesla MR spectroscopy indicated normal brain tissue whereas 3.0 Tesla MR spectroscopy indicated neoplasm. The tumor was completely resected. The histological diagnosis was fibrillary astrocytoma. Minute glioma, measuring less than 15 mm in diameter on MR imaging, can be completely resected, resulting in a good prognosis. 3.0 Tesla MR spectroscopy can establish the diagnosis in the early stage of glioma.

Title: Clinicopathological examination of glioma by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy background.
Abstract: Automation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in recent years has made it possible for MRS measurement to be performed in a shorter time than before, and the number of reports of its usefulness for the assessment of glioma malignancy has been increasing in the past several years. We studied the efficacy of proton MRS when used for glioma and conducted clinicopathological examination of glioma. The subjects were 15 patients who had received a pathological diagnosis of glioma at our hospital (6 cases of glioblastoma, 1 case of anaplastic astrocytoma, 4 cases of low-grade astrocytoma, and 4 cases of radiation necrosis); Siemens Magnetom Vision 1.5T was used for the study. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined as the areas where abnormal signals were found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Areas of primary peaks, such as choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and lactate (Lac), were measured, and the ratios to normal brain tissue were examined. This study revealed a tendency of increased malignancy of glioma with a decrease in NAA. Some cases also displayed a decrease in Cho with an increase in malignancy. Assessment of malignancy must not be based on a single ROI alone, but several ROIs should be assessed comprehensively. Measurement was difficult when the tumor volume was small. Because diagnosis of very early glioma by MRS seemed difficult, other adjunctive diagnoses may be necessary. Proton MRS is very useful for diagnosis of glioblastoma.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) non-invasively evaluates the metabolic profile of normal and abnormal brain tissue. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a highly aggressive tumor responsive to high-dose methotrexate based regimens. Patients often have complete responses but relapses are common. We characterized the MR spectra of PCNSL patients, correlated MRSI with MRI and evaluated whether early recurrence could be detected by MRSI. METHODS: Patients with PCNSL had multi-voxel MRSI before, during, and after treatment. The region of interest was defined using axial FLAIR images. Metabolites assessed were N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), lipid, and lactate. Ratios of Cho/Cr, NAA/Cho, and NAA/Cr were calculated and correlated with MRI. Overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and relative risks of each of the ratios were determined. RESULTS: MRSI was performed on 11 men and seven women; median age of 59. Sixty-seven MRSI studies were performed, 17 baseline and 48 follow-up studies. Median ratios in 16 pretreated patients were Cho/Cr-1.90, NAA/Cho-0.39, and NAA/Cr-1.27. Two patients had lipid at baseline, five had lactate and two had both. MRSI correlated with tumor response or progression on MRI; in three patients MRSI suggested disease progression prior to changes on MRI. Univariate analysis of metabolite ratios, lipid, and lactate revealed that none significantly affected PFS or OS. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the presence or absence of lipid, lactate or both revealed a trend for increased PFS. CONCLUSION: MRSI and MRI correlate with tumor response or progression and may allow early detection of disease recurrence. The presence or absence of lipid and/or lactate may have prognostic significance. Further research using MRSI needs to be done to validate our findings and determine the role of MRSI in PCNSL.

Title: 1.5 T: intraoperative imaging beyond standard anatomic imaging.
Abstract: Intraoperative high-field MRI with integrated microscope-based neuronavigation is a safe and reliable technique providing immediate intraoperative quality control. Major indications are pituitary tumor, glioma, and epilepsy surgery. Intraoperative high-field MRI provides intraoperative anatomic images at high quality that are up to the standard of pre- and postoperative neuroradiologic imaging. Compared with previous low-field MRI systems used for intraoperative imaging, not only is the image quality is clearly superior but the imaging spectrum is much wider and the intraoperative work flow is improved. Furthermore, high-field MRI offers various modalities beyond standard anatomic imaging, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI.

Title: 123I-IMT SPECT and 1H MR-spectroscopy at 3.0 T in the differential diagnosis of recurrent or residual gliomas: a comparative study.
Abstract: The aim of this investigation was to compare two current non-invasive modalities, single photon emission tomography (SPECT) using 123-iodine-alpha-methyl tyrosine (123I-IMT) and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 3.0 T, with regard to their ability to differentiate between residual/ recurrent tumors and treatment-related changes in patients pretreated for glioma. The patient population comprised 25 patients in whom recurrent glioma was suspected based on MR imaging. SPECT imaging started 10 min after iv. injection of 300-370 MBq 123I-IMT and was performed using a triple-head system. The IMT uptake was calculated semiquantitatively using regions-of-interest. 1H-MRS was performed at 3.0 T using the single-volume point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) technique. Guided by MR imaging volumes-of-interest for spectroscopy were placed into the suspected lesions. Signal intensities of choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were obtained. When using the cut-off of 1.62 for 123I-IMT uptake, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 123I-IMT SPECT were 95, 100 and 96%, respectively. For 1H-MRS, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89, 83 and 88%, respectively, based both on the metabolic ratios of Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA as tumor criterion with cut-off values of 1.11 and 1.17, respectively. In conclusion, 123I-IMT SPECT yielded more favorable results compared to 1H-MRS at distinguishing recurrent and/or residual glioma from post-therapeutic changes and may be particularly valuable when the evaluation of tumor extent is necessary.

Title: The use of 19F spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted MRI to evaluate differences in gene-dependent enzyme prodrug therapies.
Abstract: To evaluate noninvasive measures of gene expression and tumor response in a gene-dependent enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT), a bifunctional fusion gene between Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytosine deaminase (CD) and Haemophilus influenzae uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) was constructed. CD deaminates 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and UPRT subsequently converts 5FU to fluorouridine monophosphate, and both of these reactions can be monitored noninvasively in vitro and in vivo using 19F magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Following transient transfection the CD-UPRT fusion protein exhibited both UPRT and CD enzymatic activities as documented by 19F MRS. In addition, an increase in CD activity and thermal stability was witnessed for the fusion protein compared to native CD. Stable expression of CD-UPRT in 9L glioma cells increased both 5FC and 5FU sensitivity in vitro compared to CD-expressing and wild-type 9L cells. Noninvasive 19F MRS of both CD and UPRT gene function in vivo demonstrated that in animals bearing CD-expressing tumors there was limited conversion of 5FC to 5FU with no measurable accumulation of cytotoxic fluorinated nucleotides (F-nucs). In contrast, CD-UPRT-expressing tumors had increased CD gene activity with a threefold higher intratumoral accumulation of 5FU and significant generation of F-nucs. Finally, CD-UPRT yielded increased efficacy in an orthotopic animal model of high-grade glioma. More importantly, early changes in cellular water mobility, which are felt to reflect cellular death, as measured by diffusion-weighted MRI, were predictive of both durable response and increased animal survival. These results demonstrate the increased efficacy of the CD-UPRT GDEPT compared to CD alone both biochemically and in a preclinical model and validate both 19F MRS and diffusion-weighted MRI as tools to assess gene function and therapeutic efficacy.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of atypical diffuse pontine masses.
Abstract: OBJECT: Diffuse pontine gliomas in children carry a dismal prognosis, with a mean survival of less than 1 year despite therapy. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic changes demonstrated on traditional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A few typically MR imaging-appearing pontine masses, however, do not behave in the expected fashion, which calls the original diagnosis into question. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of data obtained in 42 children (age 6 months-13 years) in whom diffuse pontine glioma had been diagnosed at their institution. Five of these patients (12%) survived longer than expected (> 18 months). There were no differences in these patients in terms of demographics, presentation, traditional imaging findings, or treatment compared with the group as a whole. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, however, demonstrated two distinct patterns not seen in typical diffuse pontine gliomas. In two patients elevated lipid and lactate levels were shown, with decreased levels of choline, myoinositol, and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). In the other patients strikingly elevated choline/creatinine ratios and myoinositol levels were observed in comparison with typical pontine tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These MR spectroscopy patterns demonstrated in this retrospective study seem to convey prognostic information and may lead to an expansion of this diagnostic tool.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in the evaluation of patients undergoing gamma knife surgery for Grade IV glioma.
Abstract: OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to assess the differences in spatial extent and metabolic activity in a comparison of a radiosurgical target defined by conventional strategies that utilize the enhancing lesion and a metabolic lesion defined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging. The authors evaluated whether these differences manifest themselves in the clinical outcome of patients and assessed the value of incorporating 1H-MRS imaging-derived spatial information into the treatment planning process for gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Twenty-six patients harboring Grade IV gliomas who had previously been treated with external-beam radiation therapy were evaluated by comparing the radiosurgically treated lesion volume with the volume of metabolically active tumor defined on 1H-MRS imaging. The cohort was evenly divided into two groups based on the percentage of overlap between the radiosurgical target and the metabolic lesion volumes. Patients with a percentage of overlap greater than 50% with respect to the metabolic lesion volume were classified as low risk and those with an overlap less than 50% were classified as high risk. Kaplan-Meier estimators were calculated using time to progression and survival as dependent variables. The metabolite levels within the metabolic lesion were significantly greater than those within the radiosurgical target (p < or = 0.001). The median survival was 15.7 months for patients in the low-risk group and 10.4 months for those in the high-risk group. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results of this study indicates that patients undergoing GKS may benefit from the inclusion of 1H-MRS imaging in the treatment planning process.

Title: [Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain tumours].
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy facilitates non-invasive determination of metabolic changes in vivo. The main metabolites are the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA), cholines reflecting membrane turnover, creatine, lactate, and mobile lipids. Primary brain tumours exhibit reduced NAA and increased choline resonances compared to normal brain, and these abnormalities increase with higher malignancy. Increasing choline resonances on follow-up studies correlate with tumour progression, whereas the reduction of initially increased choline resonances indicates a transition from viable tumour to necrotic tissue. Metastases as non-neuroectodermal tumours lack NAA, but demonstrate elevated choline, lactate and lipid resonances. Lymphomas are characterised by massively increased lipid resonances with markedly elevated choline. Prominent alanine resonances are often observed in meningioma. Cystic/necrotic lesions demonstrate elevated lactate regardless of their aetiology. The characteristic finding of prominent resonances from acetate, succinate, and alanine, of leucine, isoleucine and valine in untreated bacterial abscesses allows the differentiation of bacterial abscesses from cystic/necrotic brain tumours.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy-guided biopsy for cerebral glial tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although application of proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in the diagnosis of brain tumors has been reported, the role of this technique as guidance for targeting biopsy of brain tumors is not well established. The usefulness and limitations of predicting tumor proliferative activity and pathological grading of brain gliomas based on samples obtained from proton MR spectroscopy-guided stereotactic biopsy also remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of single-voxel MR spectroscopy-guided stereotactic biopsy for cerebral gliomas and to correlate the findings of MR spectroscopy with proliferative activity (measured by Ki-67 labeling index) of tumors and pathological diagnosis. METHODS: Localized proton spectra were obtained before stereotactic/surgical biopsy in 7 patients with glioma (8 lesions). Metabolic values in the spectra were measured semiquantitatively and correlated with the Ki-67 labeling index and pathological grade of each surgical specimen. RESULTS: MR spectroscopy-guided biopsy was effective in obtaining a representative specimen for accurate pathological diagnosis in all patients, including 1 patient with multifocal glioma and 2 with diffusely infiltrated gliomas (gliomatosis cerebri). Those lesions with higher choline complex/creatine ratio (Cho/Cr) and lower N-acetyl-L-aspartate/creatine values in MR spectroscopy were higher grade tumors. Higher Ki-67 labeling index (indicating higher proliferative activity of tumor) with higher Cho/Cr ratios in MR spectroscopy were significantly correlated with tumor grade. CONCLUSIONS: MR spectroscopy-guided biopsy was effective in obtaining a representative specimen for accurate pathological diagnosis, and the Cho/Cr ratio of MR spectra and Ki-67 labeling index were reliable predictors of glioma grade.

Title: Differentiation of metastases from high-grade gliomas using short echo time 1H spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine if short echo time (TE) (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can distinguish between intracranial metastases and glioblastomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TE 30-msec spectra were acquired (1.5 T) from voxels entirely within tumors from 23 glioblastoma patients and 24 metastases patients (3 breast carcinomas, 1 bladder carcinoma, 8 lung carcinomas, 3 probable lung carcinomas, 6 melanomas, 1 stomach carcinoma, and 2 undetermined). Spectra were analyzed quantitatively (LCModel) to determine metabolite, lipid, and macromolecule concentrations. All tumors were previously untreated and classified histopathologically. RESULTS: The lipid peak area (LPA) ratio (total peak area at ca. delta1.3 to that at ca. delta0.9) was 2.6 +/- 0.6 (N = 25) for glioblastomas and 3.8 +/- 1.4 (N = 34) for metastases (P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in metabolite or lipid concentrations between the tumor groups. The LPA ratio provided 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity for discriminating metastases from glioblastomas. CONCLUSION: Lipid and macromolecule (LM) signals can dominate (1)H spectra of high-grade tumors and have characteristics that allow significant discrimination of metastases from glioblastomas. Work is now needed to determine the source and biophysical characteristics of these LM signals to further improve differentiation by optimizing the data acquisition and analysis protocol.

Title: Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase enhances tumor hypoxia: an insight into the relationship of hypoxia and angiogenesis in vivo.
Abstract: The oxygenation status of tumors derived from wild-type C6 glioma cells and clone D27 cells overexpressing dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) was assessed in vivo using a variety of direct and indirect assays of hypoxia. Clone D27 tumors exhibit a more aggressive and better-vascularized phenotype compared to wild-type C6 gliomas. Immunohistochemical analyses using the 2-nitroimidazole hypoxia marker pimonidazole, fiber optic OxyLite measurements of tumor pO2, and localized 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of tumor bioenergetic status and pH clearly demonstrated that the D27 tumors were more hypoxic compared to C6 wild type. In the tumor extracts, only glucose concentrations were significantly lower in the D27 tumors. Elevated Glut-1 expression, a reliable functional marker for hypoxia-inducible factor-1-mediated metabolic adaptation, was observed in the D27 tumors. Together, the data show that overexpression of DDAH results in C6 gliomas that are more hypoxic compared to wild-type tumors, and point strongly to an inverse relationship of tumor oxygenation and angiogenesis in vivo--a concept now being supported by the enhanced understanding of oxygen sensing at the molecular level.

Title: Combined use of F-18 fluorocholine positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for brain tumor evaluation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Choline metabolism is often abnormal in malignant brain tumors. METHODS: Brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 fluorocholine (FCH) was performed on 2 patients with intracranial lesions suspected to be high-grade malignant gliomas on the basis of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and multivoxel 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) findings. Standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements on PET were compared with measurements of choline/creatine metabolite ratio on MRSI in corresponding regions. Brain biopsy revealed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in one case and demyelinating disease in the other. RESULTS: In the case of GBM, the tumor demonstrated increased FCH uptake on PET. The mean and maximum SUV in areas of the tumor correlated with regional choline/creatine ratio measurements (r = 0.76, P < .001; r = 0.83, P < .001, respectively). In the case of tumefactive demyelinating lesions, the lesion demonstrated low FCH uptake, which did not correlate with choline/creatine ratio measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Assessments of choline metabolism may aid in evaluating intracranial mass lesions.

Title: Synthetic retinoids and their nuclear receptors.
Abstract: In addition to all-trans-retinoic acid and its 9 and 13-cis isomers, four synthetic retinoids are currently available to treat diseases of hyperproliferation, such as acne, psoriasis, and actinic keratosis, or cancers such as acute promelocytic leukemia, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma. The retinoids extert their antiproliferative effects by interacting with their retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors that act as ligand-inducible transcription factors. These homologous receptors function either directly on retinoid response elements or indirectly by modifying the responses of other transcription factors. Their major domains for binding DNA and their ligands have been characterized by either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography. The identification and design of synthetic retinoids are overviewed, as are their selective interactions with specific retinoid receptor subtypes and their clinical effects against cancer. Emphasis is placed on the retinoid X receptors and their ligands.

Title: Associations among magnetic resonance spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and image-guided histopathology with special attention to radiation necrosis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In patients with malignant glioma previously treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, clinical and radiographic signs of recurrent disease often require differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. Published work suggests that although magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can reliably differentiate pure tumor, pure necrosis, and spectroscopically normal tissues, it may not be particularly helpful because most patients have mixed histological findings comprised of necrosis and tumor. To improve our clinical ability to discriminate among these histological entities, we have analyzed MRS in conjunction with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences derived from magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: In 18 patients, spectroscopic and diffusion-weighted images were obtained before surgery for suspected recurrent neoplastic disease. Spectral data for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were derived from 65 spectroscopic observations in patients with previously treated gliomas (n = 16) and metastatic tumors (n = 2). Spectral data for choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and lipid-lactate were analyzed separately and in conjunction with ADCs in all patients (15 observations of pure tumor, 33 observations of pure necrosis, and 13 observations of mixed tumor and necrosis). Histological specimens were obtained stereotactically at the time of surgery (<48 h after image acquisition) for recurrent disease and digitally co-registered with MRS data. RESULTS: ADC values for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were 1.30, 1.60, and 1.42, respectively. Cho/NAA less than 0.20, NAA/normal Cr greater than 1.56, and NAA/Cho greater than 1.32 increase the odds that a tissue biopsy will be pure necrosis versus mixed tumor and necrosis. Although various values of all MRS ratios analyzed may provide positive correlations for histopathological differentiation of tissue between that of pure tumor and that of pure necrosis, the addition of ADC values to only NAA/Cho and NAA/normal Cr increases the odds of correct differentiation between pure tumor and pure necrosis. The addition of ADC values does not provide additional information beyond that of MRS in distinguishing specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis from either pure tumor or pure necrosis. CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that MRS ratio analysis may allow for the clinical discrimination between specimens of pure tumor and pure necrosis, and the addition of ADC data into this analysis may enhance this specific differentiation. However, although a trend toward correlation between ADC values and the various histopathological features was noted, the direct addition of ADC data does not seem to allow further discrimination, beyond that provided by MRS, among specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis and either pure tumor or pure necrosis.

Title: In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of large focal hepatic lesions and metabolite change of hepatocellular carcinoma before and after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using 3.0-T MR scanner.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the value of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the assessment of large focal hepatic lesions and to measure the metabolite change of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using 3.0-T scanner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 43 consecutive patients with large (not less than 3 cm in diameter) hepatic tumors and eight normal volunteer were included. MRS of the lesions in addition to uninvolved liver parenchyma was carried out using a whole-body 3.0-T scanner. Among the patients with proven HCC, eight lesions were evaluated before and two to five days after TACE. The choline-to-lipid (cho/lipid) ratio was measured by dividing the peak area of choline at 3.2 ppm by the peak area of lipid at 1.3 ppm. The sensitivity and specificity profiles of MRS in the diagnosis of malignant hepatic tumors were determined by plotting empirical receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The mean cho/lipid ratios in different groups before and after TACE were also measured. RESULTS: The technical success rate for MRS was 90% (53/59). The ROC curve showed proton MRS has moderate discriminating ability in diagnosing malignant hepatic tumors, although the sensitivity was less than 50% while 1-specificity was less than 20%. The area under the curve was 0.71 (P < 0.05). The mean +/- 1 standard error (SE) of cho/lipid ratios for uninvolved liver (N = 8), benign tumor (N = 8), and malignant tumor (N = 21; 19 HCC, one angiosarcoma, and one lymphoma) were 0.06 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.02, and 0.17 +/- 0.05, respectively. A significantly statistical difference (ANOVA planned contrast test, P = 0.01 and Games-Howell procedure, P = 0.03) was achieved in the mean cho/lipid ratio between malignant and benign tumors. The mean cho/lipid ratios were significantly decreased from 0.23 +/- 0.11 before TACE to 0.01 +/- 0.00 after the treatment (t = 2.01, P < 0.05, one-tail paired t-test; z = -2.37, P < 0.05, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test). CONCLUSION: In vivo proton MRS is technically feasible for the evaluation of focal hepatic lesions. The technique has potential in the detection of early metabolite change in malignant liver tumors after TACE but limitation still exists in clear differentiation between normal liver and benign and malignant tumor.

Title: 3D MRSI for resected high-grade gliomas before RT: tumor extent according to metabolic activity in relation to MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the presence of residual disease after surgery but before radiotherapy (RT) in patients with high-grade glioma by MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) and to estimate the impact of MRSI on the definition of postoperative target volumes for RT treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients (27 glioblastoma multiforme, 3 Grade III astrocytoma) underwent MRI and MRSI within 4 weeks after surgery but before the initiation of RT. The MRI data were manually contoured; the regions of interest included T(2)-weighted hyperintensity (T(2)), T(1)-weighted contrast enhancement (T(1)), and the resection cavity (RC). Levels of choline and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the three-dimensional MRSI data were analyzed on the basis of a choline-to-N-acetyl-aspartate index (CNI). The CNI and other metabolic indexes were superimposed on the MRI data as three-dimensional contours. Composite, conjoint, and disjoint volumes were defined for T(1) and T(2), with/without RC, and within the CNI contour, corresponding to a value of 2. In addition, follow-up MRI studies were examined for new onset contrast enhancement and compared with the initial spectroscopic findings obtained before RT. RESULTS: Substantial variation was found in the spatial relationship between the MRI and MRSI volumes. Ten patients had no contrast enhancement after surgery, and MRSI revealed abnormal metabolic activity in 8 of 10, averaging 20 cm(3) and extending 11-36 mm beyond the RC. In 20 patients with contrast-enhancing lesions, substantial variation was found between T(1) and CNI2; metabolic activity fell outside the contrast enhancement in 19 patients, averaging 21 cm(3) and extending 8-33 mm beyond the contrast enhancement. For all patients, the T(2) encompassed most of the metabolic volume. However, the CNI2 extended beyond the T(2) in 6 of 10 patients without contrast enhancement (mean, 8 cm(3); maximum, 15-23 mm) and in 13 of 20 patients with contrast enhancement (mean, 7 cm(3); maximum, 8-22 mm), representing an increase in the T(2) volume by as much as 180% (median 13%) and 86% (median 14%) for non-contrast-enhancing and contrast-enhancing patients, respectively. Preliminary evaluation of the MRI follow-up examinations revealed correspondence of areas of new contrast enhancement with initial MRSI abnormalities in 8 of 10 non-contrast-enhancing patients. In addition, CNI volumes correlated inversely with the time to onset of new contrast enhancement. CONCLUSION: MRSI is a valuable diagnostic tool for the assessment of residual disease after surgical resection in high-grade glioma. The incorporation of areas of metabolic abnormality into treatment planning for postoperative patients would produce different sizes and shapes of target volumes for both primary and boost volumes. It also may encourage the use of nonuniform margins to define the extent of tumor cell infiltration, rather than the current use of uniform margins.

Title: Monitoring temozolomide treatment of low-grade glioma with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Assessment of low-grade glioma treatment response remains as much of a challenge as the treatment itself. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and imaging were incorporated into a study of patients receiving temozolomide therapy for low-grade glioma in order to evaluate and monitor tumour metabolite and volume changes during treatment. Patients (n=12) received oral temozolomide (200 mg m(-2) day(-1)) over 5 days on a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. Response assessment included baseline and three-monthly magnetic resonance imaging studies (pretreatment, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) assessing the tumour size. Short (TE (echo time)=20 ms) and long (TE=135 ms) echo time single voxel spectroscopy was performed in parallel to determine metabolite profiles. The mean tumour volume change at the end of treatment was -33% (s.d.=20). The dominant metabolite in long echo time spectra was choline. At 12 months, a significant reduction in the mean choline signal was observed compared with the pretreatment (P=0.035) and 3-month scan (P=0.021). The reduction in the tumour choline/water signal paralleled tumour volume change and may reflect the therapeutic effect of temozolomide.

Title: Role of in vivo proton MR spectroscopy in the evaluation of adult brain lesions: our preliminary experience.
Abstract: CONTEXT: A definite diagnosis and characterization of intracranial mass lesions, based on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) alone may be difficult. In such cases Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) along with other non-invasive techniques represents an advance in the specificity of brain lesion diagnosis. AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of the utility of 1H-MRS in adult brain tumors and their differentiation from similar-appearing space-occupying lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRS studies were performed on 1.5 Tesla whole body MR system using standard imaging head coil. Sixty patients (aged 30-65 years), including 35 males (31-65 years) and 25 females (30-65 years) were studied, along with 25 age-matched healthy volunteers (30-64 years). The Student 't' test was used to statistically analyze the spectroscopic data for significant difference in the metabolite ratios of the lesions from normal brain tissue. RESULTS: The Cho/Cr ratio was significantly raised in low and high-grade glioma and meningioma patients (1.85 +/- 0.36, 3.50 +/- 1.00 and 6.65 +/- 2.83 respectively) (mean +/- standard deviation), as compared with the control group (1.16 +/- 0.18); and NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios were found to be lower than normal values in our study (P<0.01). However, in the non-neoplastic lesions, the Cho/Cr ratios were not statistically significant. The tubercular lesions revealed an average Cho/Cr ratio of 1.24 +/- 0.18, while it was 1.14 +/- 0.07 for infarcts. CONCLUSION: MR Spectroscopy was useful to arrive at a more definitive diagnosis in doubtful intracranial space-occupying lesions with similar morphological imaging patterns.

Title: Gliomatosis cerebri: clinical, neurochemical and neuroradiological response to temozolomide administration.
Abstract: Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare form of diffusely infiltrating glioma that is typically resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy and carries a poor prognosis. Temozolomide has shown antineoplastic activity against malignant gliomas and more recently was beneficial in one patient with gliomatosis cerebri. To make an objective assessment of the effect of long-term temozolomide administration in a patient with gliomatosis cerebri we used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural MRI. A 46-year-old man with gliomatosis cerebri was treated with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 28 days). Twenty cycles of temozolomide resulted in a marked reduction in choline and scyllo-inositol content, as detected using brain proton MR spectroscopy, indicating reduced tumor cellularity and/or growth rate. Neurochemical improvements were associated with normalization of the signal intensity in most of the previously affected cerebral regions and regression of mass effect on MRI. A left pyramidal syndrome, present at the start of the treatment, disappeared. Our observation lends support to larger clinical trials evaluating the use of temozolomide to treat this brain tumor.

Title: [CNS changes in HIV-infected patients: magnetic resonance spectroscopy].
Abstract: Changes that may appear in the central nervous system in the course of AIDS either result directly from HIV infection or--as is the case with opportunistic infections and some neoplasms--develop as a secondary consequence of general immunodeficiency. Neuroimaging techniques may be most useful in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. Basic principles of HIV encephalitis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy differentiation in MRI scans are discussed in the paper, and diagnostic possibilities of MR imaging in some other infections (tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis) are outlined. Special attention is paid, on the one hand, to difficulties in the differentiation between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma, and on the other hand--to the growing diagnostic utility of MR-spectroscopy in this respect.

Title: Use of serial proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to differentiate low grade glioma from tumefactive plaque in a patient with multiple sclerosis.
Abstract: We report on the use of serial proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) to differentiate between glioma and tumefactive plaque in a known multiple sclerosis (MS) patient who developed a symptomatic cerebral space occupying lesion. Gliomas and acute MS plaques may have indistinguishable chemical resonance spectra, whereas that of chronic plaque is distinct. In our case (1)H MRS demonstrated elevated concentrations of choline, lactate and lipid, with reduced N-acetyl aspartate, a pattern consistent with either low grade glioma or acute demyelinating plaque. A repeat study 4 months later showed no change, this was felt to be incompatible with the natural history of an acute plaque and low grade glioma was diagnosed. Surgical removal of the lesion revealed an oligodendroglioma, confirming the imaging findings.

Title: The use of proton MRS in the differential diagnosis of brain tumors and tumor-like processes.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Progress in the treatment of brain neoplasms requires accurate identification of tumor type and grade, before a proper treatment plan can be implemented. The aim of our study was to investigate the use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the differential diagnosis of neoplastic brain tumors and tumor-like processes. MATERIAL/METHODS: 29 patients with ambiguous CT images of brain mass lesions were examined by MRI. 1H MRS was applied in this group as the primary option to improve differential diagnosis. In each case a routine MRI was taken in three orthogonal planes before and after i.v. administration of Gd-DTPA. 1H MRS was performed at 1.5 T using the PRESS (TE 136 ms) and STEAM (TE 20 ms) single voxel spectroscopy techniques. MRS was performed after i.v. administration of Gd-DTPA. The lesion types according to spectral patterns were compared to postoperative pathology or biopsy results. RESULTS: MRS-based diagnosis was consistent with pathology results in all cases of astrocytoma, glioblastoma and meningioma. In two cases distinguishing brain metastases from glioblastomas was difficult because of contamination of the voxel with brain tissue. Three cases of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were misclassified as glioblastomas. In two cases MR spectra indicating an inflammatory-demyelinating process correlated with biopsy results and clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: 1HMRS proved to be a useful tool in establishing tumor type and differentiating between neoplastic and large inflammatory tumor-like lesions.

Title: Correlation between preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopic data on high grade gliomas and morphology of Ki-67-positive tumor cell nuclei.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible statistical correlations between metabolic data from preoperative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS) and morphology of proliferating tumor cell nuclei in anaplastic gliomas and glioblastomas. STUDY DESIGN: Ki-67-positive tumor cell nuclei in paraffin sections of surgical specimens from 36 patients (7 anaplastic gliomas, World Health Organization grade 3; 29 glioblastomas, World Health Organization grade 4) were investigated by means of a digital image analysis system. Stringent inclusion criteria were formulated for all cases with respect to histologic quality and spectroscopic examination. As morphometric variables, nuclear area, shape variables (roundness factor, size-invariate Fourier amplitudes) and density of Ki-67-positive tumor cell nuclei per reference area were determined. RESULTS: Correlation analysis according to Spearman revealed a significant positive correlation between the total creatine (TCR) peak and nuclear area (P = .005). This correlation was also found within the glioblastoma group (P = .019). There was also a significant negative correlation of nuclear area with the ratio between choline and TCR in all cases (P = .014) and within the glioblastoma group (P = .046). No significant correlation of spectroscopic data was found with nuclear shape or density of Ki-67-positive tumor cell nuclei. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate a correlation between spectroscopic data and morphology of proliferating tumor cell nuclei (nuclear size) in high grade gliomas. This study is part of a detailed investigation of the interrelationship between preoperative 1HMRS and quantitative histomorphology of gliomas.

Title: [Evaluation of cerebral glioma with advanced magnetic resonance techniques].
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice for the radiological evaluation of cerebral gliomas. Determination of its malignant grade is important for therapeutic approach and prognosis. The authors focus on the utility of MRI advanced techniques, namely proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, perfusion and diffusion. These techniques are complementary to conventional MRI and allow improved non-invasive early evaluation of malignant grade of gliomas. Moreover, these techniques are useful in the determination of the most malignant areas of the tumours, which are potential targets for stereotaxic biopsy and therapy. They also have particular utility on the distinction between residual tumor, recurrence and radiation necrosis.

Title: Could assessment of glioma methylene lipid resonance by in vivo (1)H-MRS be of clinical value?
Abstract: The potential clinical role of in vivo (1)H-MRS ((1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) lipid methylene resonance measurements of human glioma has been assessed. 20 patients, 14 with low grade and 6 with high grade gliomas have been investigated using single voxel (1)H-MRS. Three of the low grade group had undergone transformation by clinical and imaging criteria. Short echo time (TE=20 ms, TR=2500 ms) single voxel Stimulated Echo Acquisition (STEAM) spectra with (acquisitions=64) and without (acquisitions=4) water suppression were acquired. Additionally, T(1) weighted (T(1)W) water spectra (TE=20 ms, TR=888 ms) were acquired pre- and post-injection of Gd-DTPA (0.2 mmol x kg(-1)). The T(1)W water spectra were used to determine the water proton enhancement occurring within the spectroscopic voxel. The enhancement expressed as a percentage was compared with the lipid methylene peak. All the high grade tumours had significantly higher levels of lipid than low grade tumours (p=0.002). Low grade tumours had significantly less water proton enhancement than transformers (p=0.04) and high grade tumours (p=0.001). The lipid methylene signal correlated strongly with the voxel water enhancement (r(2)=0.74, p<0.0001). The data support the view that the spectroscopically detected lipid methylene signal may be a useful criterion in grading glioma. The correlation of the lipid methylene signal with blood-brain barrier breakdown suggests that detection of a previously absent (1)H-MRS lipid methylene signal in low grade tumours might be an early indicator of transformation.

Title: Differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioma in humans using localised proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: In order to characterise primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) and to evaluate if 1H spectroscopy improves the preoperative differential diagnosis of PCNSL and glioma, seven immunocompetent patients with PCNSL and 21 patients with glioma were examined using single voxel, short echo time magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS; 1.5 T, STEAM 1500/20). All PCNSL demonstrated massively elevated lipid resonances and markedly elevated choline. Similarly increased lipid resonances were only found in seven necrotic glioblastomas, PCNSL differing from all solid astrocytomas by massively elevated lipid resonances. Additionally, PCNSL had higher Cho/Cr ratios than all grades of astrocytoma. In conclusion, we found that massively elevated lipid resonances are a hallmark of PCNSL in immunocompetent patients. Together with a markedly elevated Cho/Cr ratio, MRS provides metabolic information which may improve the preoperative differentiation of PCNSL and glioma.

Title: Radiological response and histological changes in malignant astrocytic tumors after stereotactic radiosurgery.
Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an encouraging approach to deliver higher doses of radiation boost for malignant gliomas safely and precisely. The purpose of this study was to investigate the radiation response and histological changes of malignant astrocytic tumors after stereotactic linac radiosurgery (SLRS). We studied an autopsy case of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and two surgical cases with gross total removal of recurrent GBM and anaplastic astrocytoma transformed from fibrillary astrocytoma treated with SLRS. Destructive changes, such as the disappearance of viable cells, coagulation necrosis, and fibrinoid degeneration of vascular walls, were observed in the center of the target of SLRS, which showed histologically similar radiobiological reactions to well-known delayed central nervous system radiation necrosis caused by conventional radiotherapy. The region showing such radiation necrosis was within the area irradiated with approximately 15-20Gy or more by SLRS; however, dense viable tumor cells remained in the periphery that was irradiated with less than 15Gy. In a comparative immunohistochemical study of the tumors before and after SLRS, neither MIB-1 and p53 labeling indices nor immunoreactivity for GFAP represented any persistent tendencies. There were very few TUNEL-positive cells in either tumor before and after SLRS. These results showed that radiosurgery for malignant gliomas leads to earlier radiation necrosis than conventional radiation and that it is useful in eradicating tumor cells in the center of the target. However, some viable tumor cells may remain in the periphery irradiated with an insufficient dose for cell death and may be partly transformed in character by DNA damage due to radiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was suggested to characterize the radiation response in radiosurgery tumor targets for correlation with histological findings.

Title: [Contribution of magnetic resonance spectrometry to the diagnosis of intracranial tumors].
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a method enabling the analysis of the tissue metabolic content. It may offer a more accurate diagnosis of the intracranial tumors than conventional MRI sequences. MRS of normal brain parenchyma displays 4 main metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (neuronal marker), creatine (cellular density marker), choline (membrane activity marker) and myoinositol (glial marker); pathological processes lead to variations of the level of these metabolites and/or the appearance of abnormal metabolites (lactate), following different patterns according to pathological process involved: glioma, meningioma, metastasis, bacterial or toxoplasmic abscess, radionecrosis. The potential clinical use of this method includes positive, differential and etiological diagnosis of tumors, determination of the level of malignancy of gliomas, screening for tumor recurrence following treatment. Our laboratory has been performing MR spectroscopic explorations of brain tumors for many years. Based on this experience, we show how MRS can be routinely performed in the clinical setting, what are its limitations and potential, and what kind of information can be supplied to the clinician.

Title: Use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain to differentiate gliomatosis cerebri from low-grade glioma.
Abstract: OBJECT: Gliomatosis cerebri (GC), a rare entity characterized by a widespread infiltration of brain by tumor, lacks objective and quantitative diagnostic criteria. Single-voxel spectroscopy and chemical shift imaging (two-dimensional proton magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy) were performed using both short (20- or 22-msec) and long (135-msec) echo times in nine patients suffering from GC, nine patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs), and 25 healthy volunteers to establish the precise metabolic pattern of this uncommon brain neoplasm. METHODS: The gliomatosis infiltration was characterized by markedly elevated levels of creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr) and mvo-inositol (Ins), a reduced level of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and a moderately elevated level of choline-containing compounds (Cho). This pattern differs strikingly from LGGs, which are characterized by elevated levels of Cho and Ins, markedly reduced levels of NAA, and low-to-normal Cr concentrations. Although the distinction between GC and LGG, based on histological and MR imaging criteria, is a matter of debate, MR spectroscopy produces valuable information for the differentiation between these two entities and, hence, the choice of therapeutic strategy. It also provides new insight into the pathophysiology of GC because elevated Cr and Ins levels may be related to proliferation of glial elements or, more probably, activation of normal glia. Elevated levels of Cho reflect cellular proliferation and reduced NAA corresponds to reversible neuronal injury and/or focal invasion by the tumor process. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the unfavorable clinical outcome associated with GC compared with that associated with LGG, the findings of this study illustrate the diagnostic and prognostic value of proton MR spectroscopy in the characterization of infiltrating gliomas.

Title: Histopathological validation of a three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy index as a predictor of tumor presence.
Abstract: OBJECT: Data obtained preoperatively from three-dimensional (3D)/proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy were compared with the results of histopathological assays of tissue biopsies obtained during surgery to verify the sensitivity and specificity of a choline-containing compound-N-acetylaspartate index (CNI) used to distinguish tumor from nontumorous tissue within T2-hyperintense and contrast-enhancing lesions of patients with untreated gliomas. The information gleaned from the biopsy correlation study was used to test the hypothesis that there is metabolically active tumor in nonenhancing regions of the T2-hyperintense lesion that can be detected using MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Patients suspected of harboring a glioma underwent 3D MR spectroscopy during their preoperative MR imaging examination. Surgical navigation techniques were used to record the location of tissue biopsies collected during open resection of the tumor. A receiver operating curve analysis of the CNI and histological characteristics of specimens at each biopsy location was performed to determine the optimal threshold of the CNI required to separate tumor from nontumorous tissue. Histograms of the CNIs within enhancing and nonenhancing regions of lesions appearing on MR images were generated to determine the spatial distribution of CNIs consistent with tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy samples containing tumor were distinguished from those containing a mixture of normal, edematous, gliotic, and necrotic tissue with 90% sensitivity and 86% specificity by using a CNI threshold of 2.5. The CNIs of nontumorous specimens were significantly different from those of biopsy specimens containing Grade II (p < 0.03), Grade III (p < 0.005), and Grade IV (p < 0.01) tumors. On average, one third to one half of the T2-hyperintense lesion outside the contrast-enhancing lesion contained CNI greater than 2.5.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of cancer-practicalities of multi-centre trials and early results in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Abstract: This review describes problems and solutions encountered in large scale multicentre trials of Magnetic Resonance Methods for monitoring cancer. It is illustrated with reference to the Multi-Institutional Group on Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) Applications to Cancer which was set up to perform a trial of 31P MRS for monitoring non-invasively chemotherapy of solid tumours. 31P MR spectra of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) pre- and posttreatment, across nine Institutions, were acquired on either General Electric (GE) or Siemens 1.5T Clinical MR instruments. Development of the trial protocol, design of the Radio Frequency (RF) coils and Quality Control procedures necessary to ensure that the datasets acquired at each centre were comparable, are described. The data revealed that phosphomonoesters (PME)/nucleotide triphosphates (NTP) ratio decreased significantly after treatment in the Complete (P<0.001) and Partial (P<0.05) Responders but not in the Non-Responders (P>0.1). In addition, the PME/NTP ratio in the pre-treatment spectra correlated with the subsequent outcome of treatment indicating that PME/NTP levels are significant predictors of long-term clinical response and time-to-treatment failure in NHL.

Title: Intracranial ganglioglioma: preoperative characteristics and oncologic outcome after surgery.
Abstract: In order to investigate the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings, pathological features, treatment, and outcomes, and to provide valuable guidance for the diagnosis and management of intracranial gangliogliomas, 34 cases of intracranial gangliogliomas were retrospectively analyzed. This study included 23 males and 11 females. Age at operation ranged from 17 days to 50 years. All patients had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), 18F-FDG-PET (positron emission tomography), and 99Tc-HMPAO-SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) were also performed in some cases. All pathological specimens and all available neuroimages were re-evaluated. The follow-up period varied from 12 to 89 months (mean 36 months). Seizure was the most common presenting symptom (85%). Tumor calcification was detected by CT scan in six of 11 cases. Seventeen gangliogliomas (50%) showed cystic components and 18 tumors (53%) were enhanced on MRI. All temporal lobe gangliogliomas were located intracortically and most of them had poor demarcation on MRI. In comparison with the contralateral normal area, the gangliogliomas showed a reduced Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratio, and an increased Cho/NAA ratio. On 18F-FDG-PET, gangliogliomas were usually hypometabolic. HMPAO-SPECT indicated tumor hypoperfusion or isoperfusion. A gross total resection was achieved in 25 patients. Tumor progression was observed in three patients who underwent an incomplete tumor resection. Two of them underwent a malignant transformation to a glioblastoma. Twenty-seven patients could carry on their normal life activity with the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of more than 80. Even though ganglioglioma is a slowly growing benign tumor, which could be demonstrated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), PET, and SPECT, there is a chance of malignant transformation, especially in cases of incomplete tumor resection. Gangliogliomas should be resected gross totally, if feasible, to achieve the best long-term outcomes.

Title: Brain abscess and glioblastoma identified by combined proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging--two case reports.
Abstract: The differential diagnosis between brain abscesses and necrotic tumors such as glioblastomas is sometimes difficult to establish by conventional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Combined proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) were used to establish the preoperative diagnosis of brain abscess and glioblastoma. DWI visualized the brain abscess as a homogeneous hyperintense lesion and 1H-MRS revealed the presence of acetate, lactate, and amino acids and the absence of the normal brain components. DWI sometimes shows glioblastoma as a hyperintense lesion, but 1H-MRS reveals markedly increased lactate and decreased N-acetyl-aspartate. Combined DWI and 1H-MRS findings can distinguish brain abscess and glioblastoma.

Title: Cerebral infarct mimicking glioma in Sjogren's syndrome.
Abstract: A 50-year-old Chinese woman with a chronic 20-year history of ataxic gait associated with dry eyes and mouth, was admitted to hospital after a single episode of syncope. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a large left frontal hypodense lesion suggestive of a glioma. Craniotomy was performed and the lesion excised, with histology showing only infarcted tissue and no malignant cells. Further diagnostic evaluation revealed that the patient had primary Sjogren's syndrome, with demyelinating polyneuropathy. In the absence of risk factors for stroke, it was considered likely that the cerebral infarct was secondary to autoimmune-related vasculitis. Functional neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, should be considered in evaluating doubtful or unusual brain lesions in patients with autoimmune disease.

Title: Metastasis of breast cancer to intracranial meningioma: case report.
Abstract: Metastasis of systemic cancer to intracranial tumors is a rare event. The authors report a case of 49-year-old woman with such occurrence, whose breast cancer metastasized to a preexisting parasagittal meningioma at a postoperative interval of 1.5 years. She was admitted to our hospital because of progressive right hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed newly emerged perifocal edema and inhomogeneous contrast enhancement of the meningioma. High choline/creatine ratio and lactate/lipid peak on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggested malignancy. She underwent a tumor resection, and pathologic examination revealed intratumoral metastasis of breast cancer in a transitional meningioma. Immunoreactivity of E-cadherin was detected in both meningioma and breast cancer cells. It is suggested that abrupt appearance of symptoms, inhomogeneous enhancement, and perifocal edema of meningioma is a sign of intratumoral metastasis from systemic cancers.

Title: Metabolic imaging of low-grade gliomas with three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The role of radiotherapy (RT) seems established for patients with low-grade gliomas with poor prognostic factors. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) has been reported to be of value in defining the extent of glioma infiltration. We performed a study examining the impact MRSI would have on the routine addition of 2-3-cm margins around MRI T2-weighted hyperintensity to generate the treatment planning clinical target volume (CTV) for low-grade gliomas. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with supratentorial gliomas WHO Grade II (7 astrocytomas, 6 oligoastrocytomas, 7 oligodendrogliomas) underwent MRI and MRSI before surgery. The MRI was contoured manually; the regions of interest included T2 hyperintensity and, if present, regions of contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images. The 3D-MRSI peak parameters for choline and N-acetyl-aspartate, acquired voxel-by-voxel, were categorized using a choline/N-acetyl-aspartate index (CNI), a tool for quantitative assessment of tissue metabolite levels, with CNI 2 being the lowest value corresponding to tumor. CNI data were aligned to MRI and displayed as 3D contours. The relationship between the anatomic and metabolic information on tumor extent was assessed by comparing the CNI contours and other MRSI-derived metabolites to the MRI T2 volume. RESULTS: The limitations in the size of the region "excited" meant that MRSI could be used to evaluate only a median 68% of the T2 volume (range 38-100%), leaving the volume T2c. The CNI 2 volume (median 29 cm(3), range 10-73) was contained totally within the T2c in 55% of patients. In the remaining patients, the volume of CNI 2 extending beyond the T2c was quite small (median 2.3 cm(3), range 1.4-5.2), but was not distributed uniformly about the T2c, extending up to 22 mm beyond it. Two patients demonstrated small regions of contrast enhancement corresponding to the regions of highest CNI. Other metabolites, such as creatine and lactate, seem useful for determining less and more radioresistant areas, respectively. CONCLUSION: Metabolically active tumor, as detected by MRSI, is restricted mainly to the T2 hyperintensity in low-grade gliomas, but can extend outside it in a limited and nonuniform fashion up to 2 cm. Therefore, a CTV including T2 and areas of CNI extension beyond the T2 hyperintensity would result in a reduction in the size and a change in the shape of the standard clinical target volumes generated by adding uniform margins of 2-3 cm to the T2 hyperintensity.

Title: Biochemical characterization of pediatric brain tumors by using in vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: OBJECT: Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy provides biochemical information about tumors. The authors sought to determine the relationship between in vivo and ex vivo biochemical characterization of pediatric brain tumors by using MR spectroscopy. Their hypothesis was that ex vivo MR spectroscopy provides a link between in vivo MR spectroscopy and neuropathological analysis. METHODS: In vivo proton MR spectroscopy was performed before surgery in 11 patients with neuroepithelial tumors. During resection, a total of 40 tumor biopsy samples were obtained from within the volume of interest identified on in vivo MR spectroscopy and were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HRMAS) was used to perform ex vivo MR spectroscopy in these 40 tumor biopsy samples. Neuropathological analysis was performed using the same biopsy samples, and the tumors were classified as ependymoma, choroid plexus carcinoma, pineoblastoma (one each), and pilocytic astrocytoma, medullobastoma, low-grade glioma, and glioblastoma multiforme (two each). Ex vivo HRMAS MR spectroscopy improved line widths and line shapes in the spectra, compared with in vivo MR spectroscopy. Choline (Cho) detected in vivo corresponded to three different peaks ex vivo (glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine [PCho], and Cho). Metabolite ratios from in vivo spectra correlated with ratios from ex vivo spectra (Pearson correlation coefficient range r = 0.72-0.91; p < or = 0.01). Metabolite ratios from ex vivo spectra, such as PCho/ total creatine (tCr) and lipid/tCr, correlated with the percentage of cancerous tissue and percentage of tumor necrosis, respectively (r = 0.84; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between in vivo and ex vivo MR spectroscopy indicates that ex vivo HRMAS MR spectroscopy can improve resolution of this modality and provide a link between in vivo MR spectroscopy and neuropathological analysis.

Title: 1H-MRS in vivo predicts the early treatment outcome of postoperative radiotherapy for malignant gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To analyze prospectively the prognostic significance of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in vivo recorded from the tumor bed of patients after surgery for malignant glioma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-one patients aged 20-68 years were examined using a MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige). Of the 51 patients, 33 had Grade 3 gliomas and 18 had glioblastomas. MRI-localized 1HMR spectra were acquired using a single-voxel, double-spin-echo sequence. Relative intensities of the signals (choline, creatine [Cr] N-acetyl aspartate [NAA], myo-inositol, lactate, and lipids) were obtained by numeric integration of fitted signals. Two voxels were examined, one located at the tumor bed and the second distant to the tumor bed. All patients were irradiated to 60 Gy using three-dimensional conformal noncoplanar techniques to 60 Gy. RESULTS: MRS in vivo in patients after brain tumor surgery revealed a statistically significant decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio and increases in the choline/creatine (Cr), choline/NAA, and myo-inosytol/Cr ratios. The intensive signals of lactate and lipids appeared in spectrum. Survival correlated strongly with tumor grade and patient age but the strongest prognostic factor was the lactate/NAA ratio. For lactate/NAA values >2.0 (intensive lactate signal) the 1-year survival rate was 20%, and for lactate/NAA values <2.0, the 1-year survival rate was 85%. CONCLUSION: A new diagnostic tool demonstrated ability to distinguish between patients with a favorable prognosis and those who will die within 1 year.

Title: Characterization of lipids from human brain tissues by multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Multinuclear ((1)H, (13)C, and (31)P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy are applied to the biochemical characterization of the total lipid fraction of healthy and neoplastic human brain tissues. Lipid extracts from normal brains, glioblastomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, oligodendrogliomas, and meningiomas are examined. Moreover, the unknown liquid content of a cyst adjacent to a meningioma is analyzed. Two biopsies from glioblastomas are directly studied by (1)H-NMR without any treatment (ex vivo NMR). The (1)H- and (13)C-NMR analysis allows full characterization of the lipid component of the cerebral tissues. In particular, the presence of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in the extracts of high grade tumors is correlated to the vascular proliferation degree, which is different from normal brain tissue and low grade neoplasms. The (31)P spectra show that phosphatidylcholine is the prominent phospholipid and its relative amount, which is higher in gliomas, is correlated to the low grade of differentiation of tumor cells and an altered membrane turnover. The ex vivo (1)H-NMR data on the glioblastoma samples show the presence of mobile lipids that are correlated to cell necrotic phenomena. Our data allow a direct correlation between biochemical results obtained by NMR and the histopathological factors (vascular and cell proliferations, differentiation, and necrosis) that are prominent in determining brain tumor grading.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cerebral glioma after irradiation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly employed to assess cerebral gliomas after radiotherapy, but it cannot always differentiate tumor regrowth from post-irradiation changes. In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to evaluate changes in cerebral metabolites in patients with a cerebral glioma after irradiation. METHODS: Over a period of 3 years, we performed MRS after MRI whenever soft tissue masses were found on magnetic resonance (MR) images. A total of 122 MR spectra of 58 patients was used for analysis. Spectral interpretations were based on integral values of the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho) compounds relative to phosphocreatine/creatine (Cr). RESULTS: Our MRS study showed that higher Cho/Cr ratios occurred in regrowing gliomas than for stable diseases (range, 0.9 to 9.5 vs. 0.4 to 2.1; mean, 3.0 vs. 1.2). A greater increment in the Cho/Cr ratio between successive studies was also noted in regrowing gliomas than for stable disease (range, 41% to 87% vs. < 32%). No significant differences in NAA/Cr ratios or lactate were found between these 2 groups. None of our patients exhibited abnormal MR spectra in the mirror area of the contralateral brain. CONCLUSION: MRS provides valuable information about the metabolism of irradiated gliomas and can be used to exclude radiation encephalopathy of the contralateral brain. Cho is the most reliable indicator of a regrowing glioma. A high Cho/Cr ratio or substantial elevation in the Cho/Cr ratio between serial studies increases the likelihood of tumor regrowth. However, lower Cho/Cr ratios were inconclusive for determining if tumor regrowth or a stable process was occurring.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain lesions in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.
Abstract: Two of the recognized cranial MRI findings in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are neurofibromatosis bright objects (NBO) and brain glioma. Their differential diagnosis can be problematic. This study aimed to determine the features of these abnormalities on short echo-time in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Twenty children under the age of 16 with NF1 were studied. A single voxel, short echo-time technique (TE = 20 ms; TR = 5000 ms) was used to obtain proton spectra of typical NBO and any regions suggestive of atypical bright objects or tumor. Nine children without neurofibromatosis with no structural brain abnormality acted as aged-matched comparisons. A semi-quantitative analysis indicated significant increase in choline and myo-inisitol in tumors compared to typical NBO (p < 0.05) and compared to controls (p < 0.05); reduction in the levels of N-acetyl moieties in NBO compared to controls (p < 0.05); reduction in N-acetyl in tumors compared to controls (p < 0.001); and reduction in glutamate/glutamine in tumors compared to controls (p < 0.05). This cross-sectional data suggests that proton spectroscopy can aid differentiating between NBO and brain (non-optic/hypothalamic) glioma. Typical NBO have different short echo-time spectroscopic appearances compared to normal brain.

Title: Significant differences in the retention of the borocaptate monomer (BSH) and dimer (BSSB) in malignant cells.
Abstract: The (10)B enriched form of Na(2)B(12)H(11)SH (BSH) is used in a binary cancer radiation treatment, known as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The BSH anion can also form a dimer, [B(24)H(22)S(2)](4-) (BSSB), previously used in animal model studies. It is demonstrated here that the retention of BSSB in mouse M2R melanoma and rat C6 glioma cells is significantly longer than that of the monomer BSH. The washout of the BNCT agents from cultured cells was followed using (11)B nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. One hour after switching to boron-free culture medium, the relative amount of BSSB retained in M2R cells was at least about six times higher than that of BSH. The initial washout rate (over the first approximately 4 h) of BSSB was 4x10(-3) min(-1) (t(1/2), approximately 3 h) for M2R cells, and of the same order of magnitude for glioma cells.

Title: Correlation between magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging and image-guided biopsies: semiquantitative and qualitative histopathological analyses of patients with untreated glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Since intratumoral heterogeneity of gliomas is not adequately reflected in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we sought to determine a correlation between different proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRSI) metabolic ratios and the degree of tumor infiltration in diffusely infiltrating gliomas. In this report, we describe the microscopic anatomy of gliomas on imaging. METHODS: Image-guided biopsies with semiquantitative and qualitative histopathological analyses from a series of 31 untreated patients with low- and high-grade gliomas were correlated with multivoxel (1)H MRSI referenced to the same spatial coordinates. RESULTS: This series yielded 247 tissue samples and 307 observations. Choline-containing compounds using contralateral creatine and choline for normalization or ipsilateral N-acetylaspartate appear to correlate best with the degree of tumor infiltration. Similar correlations were present within each grade after stratification. Despite the interpatient overlap of metabolic ratios between normal tissue and mild tumor infiltration, preliminary analyses revealed that (1)H MRSI appears more accurate than conventional MRI in defining the tumor boundary and quantifying the degree of tumor infiltration. CONCLUSION: This is the first study showing histopathological validation of tumor boundaries using (1)H MRSI. These results support the conclusion that (1)H MRSI accurately reflects the extent of the disease in patients with gliomas. This has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for more accurately assessing the burden of disease as well as for planning and assessing response to therapy.

Title: Differentiation between high-grade glioma and metastatic brain tumor using single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to clarify the efficacy of single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in differentiating high-grade glioma from metastasis. Thirty-one high-grade gliomas (11 anaplastic gliomas and 20 glioblastomas) and 25 metastases were studied. Proton MRS was performed using point-resolved spectroscopy with echo times (TEs) of both 136 and 30 ms. The peaks for lipid were evaluated at short TE, and those for N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline-containing compounds (Cho) were assessed at long TE. All the tumors exhibited a strong Cho peak at long TE. Twenty-one of 25 metastases showed no definite Cr peak. The remaining 4 metastases showed NAA and Cr peaks; however, the presence of NAA and relatively high NAA/Cr ratio (1.58+/-0.56) indicated normal brain contamination. All the gliomas, except for a single glioblastoma, showed a Cr peak with (n=16) or without (n=14) NAA. At short TE all metastases and glioblastomas showed definite lipid or lipid/lactate mixture, but anaplastic gliomas showed no definite lipid signal. Intratumoral Cr suggests glioma. Absence of Cr indicates metastasis. Definite lipid signal indicates cellular necrosis in glioblastoma and metastasis, and no lipid signal may exclude metastases.

Title: High glycolytic activity in rat glioma demonstrated in vivo by correlation peak 1H magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: High-grade brain tumors are known to have a high rate of glucose (Glc) consumption. Postmortem measurements have suggested that Glc content in experimental brain tumors is relatively low. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate this, in vivo, in the brains of seven rats bearing intracerebral C6 gliomas. We combined the high spectral resolution allowed by two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance with spatial encoding by magnetic field gradient pulses to obtain in vivo maps of Glc, alanine, hypotaurine, aspartate, phosphoethanolamine, Glu/Gln, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), phosphocreatine/creatine (PCr/Cr), choline-containing compounds, and lactate (Lac) (some of which are involved in energy metabolism). Compared with normal brain tissue, the main differences found in the gliomas were that Glc, NAA, PCr/Cr, and aspartate concentrations were much lower, whereas concentrations of alanine, hypotaurine, phosphoethanolamine, and Lac were higher, whatever the extent of necrosis. A striking observation is the similarity of the NAA and Glc images: the concentrations of both metabolites are lower in the tumor than they are in the contralateral brain. If Glc was completely absent from the tumor tissue, and if the residual Glc level was due only to a partial volume effect like that for NAA, a neuronal marker, the ratio [Glc]tumor/[Glc]contralateral tissue, should be similar to that found for NAA. The ratio for Glc was 0.48 +/- 0.22 (+/- SD; n = 6), a ratio similar to that found for PCr/Cr (0.50 +/- 0.19) but significantly higher than that obtained for NAA (0.29 +/- 0.07). This observation indicates that a measurable Glc concentration is still present in the tumor tissue. Intense glycolysis in tumor cells may explain the increased production of Lac and alanine and decreased amount of Glc. These nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of metabolite concentrations are complementary to positron emission tomography, which measures Glc consumption.

Title: Discrimination of brain abscess and cystic tumor by in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was evaluated for the differentiation of brain abscesses and cystic brain tumors. Proton MR spectroscopy was performed in vivo in two patients with brain abscess and eight patients with various cystic brain tumors (anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, and metastatic brain tumor). MR imaging with contrast medium demonstrated ring-like enhanced mass lesions in all patients. The various resonance peaks in proton MR spectra were assigned to metabolites according to chemical shifts. Treatment of the cystic brain lesions was based on the information from proton MR spectroscopy. Aspirated pus from one patient with brain abscess was examined using ex vivo proton MR spectroscopy. The in vivo spectra of brain abscess contained resonance peaks attributed to acetate, lactate, alanine, amino acids, and lipids in both cases, and an additional peak of succinate in one case. In vivo spectra of the neoplasms contained resonance peaks corresponding to lactate, lipids, choline, creatine, and N-acetyl aspartate. Proton MR spectroscopy is useful for discriminating brain abscess from cystic tumors with similar neuroimaging appearance, which is very important for determining the treatment strategy.

Title: Quantification of microheterogeneity in glioblastoma multiforme with ex vivo high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Microheterogeneity is a routinely observed neuropathologic characteristic in brain tumor pathology. Although microheterogeneity is readily documented by routine histologic techniques, these techniques only measure tumor status at the time of biopsy or surgery and do not indicate likely tumor progression. A biochemical screening technique calibrated against pathologic standards would greatly assist in predicting tumor progression from its biological activity. Here we demonstrate for the first time that proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) with high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS), a technique introduced in 1997, can preserve tissue histopathologic features while producing well-resolved spectra of cellular metabolites in the identical intact tissue specimens. Observed biochemical alterations and tumor histopathologic characteristics can thus be correlated for the same surgical specimen, obviating the problems caused by tumor microheterogeneity. We analyzed multiple specimens of a single human glioblastoma multiforme surgically removed from a 44-year-old patient. Each specimen was first measured with HRMAS 1H MRS to determine tumor metabolites, then evaluated by quantitative histopathology. The concentrations of lactate and mobile lipids measured with HRMAS linearly reflected the percentage of tumor necrosis. Moreover, metabolic ratios of phosphorylcholine to choline correlated linearly with the percentage of the highly cellular malignant glioma. The quantification of tumor metabolic changes with HRMAS 1H MRS, in conjunction with subsequent histopathology of the same tumor specimen, has the potential to further our knowledge of the biochemistry of tumor heterogeneity during development, and thus ultimately to improve our accuracy in diagnosing, characterizing, and evaluating tumor progression.

Title: Relationships between choline magnetic resonance spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficient and quantitative histopathology in human glioma.
Abstract: This study sought to correlate quantitative presurgical proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) and diffusion imaging (DI) results with quantitative histopathological features of resected glioma tissue. The primary hypotheses were (1) glioma choline signal correlates with cell density, (2) glioma apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) correlates inversely with cell density, (3) glioma choline signal correlates with cell proliferative index. Eighteen adult glioma patients were preoperatively imaged with 1H-MRSI and DI as part of clinically-indicated MRI evaluations. Cell density and proliferative index readings were made on surgical specimens obtained at surgery performed within 12 days of the radiologic scans. The resected tissue location was identified by comparing preoperative and postoperative MRI. The tumor to contralateral normalized choline signal ratio (nCho) and the ADC from resected tumor regions were measured from the preoperative imaging data. Counts of nuclei per high power field in 5-10 fields provided a quantitative measure of cell density. MIB-1 immunohistochemistry provided an index of the proportion of proliferating cells. There was a statistically significant inverse linear correlation between glioma ADC and cell density. There was also a statistically significant linear correlation between the glioma nCho and the cell density. The nCho measure did not significantly correlate with proliferative index. The results indicate that both ADC and spectroscopic choline measures are related to glioma cell density. Therefore they may prove useful for differentiating dense cellular neoplastic lesions from those that contain large proportions of acellular necrotic space.

Title: Correlation of myo-inositol levels and grading of cerebral astrocytomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a limited number of patients, the level of myo-inositol (MI), as seen by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HMRS), has been shown to differ for gliomas of different histologic grades. We sought to determine if MI levels correlate with cerebral astrocytoma grade. METHODS: Five control subjects, 14 patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 10 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent single-volume HMRS with an echo time of 20 ms. Twenty-five patients had received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy previously. Using the curve-fitting program supplied by the manufacturer, peak areas for n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and MI were normalized with respect to the peak area of creatine (Cr). Ratios for MI/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cr were obtained for each lesion and retrospectively compared with the histologic grade of the lesion. RESULTS: Levels of MI/Cr were higher (0.82 +/- 0.25) in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, intermediate (0.49 +/- 0.07) in control subjects, and lower in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (0.33 +/- 0.16) and GBM (0.15 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a trend toward lower MI levels in the presence of anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs compared with those of low-grade astrocytomas. MI levels may have implications in the grading of cerebral astrocytomas.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy reflects cellular proliferative activity in astrocytomas.
Abstract: We examined whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) could provide accurate information on histological grade and cell proliferation in astrocytomas. We studied 23 patients with astrocytomas: five grade II, 10 grade III and eight with grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme). We performed proton MRS and determined the Ki-67 labeling index (LI), a tumour proliferation marker, in the same areas of the astrocytomas, and examined the statistical relationship between proton MRS and Ki-67 LI. The N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr) and NAA/choline (Cho)-containing compound ratios were always significantly lower and the Cho/Cr ratios significantly higher than those for normal brain. The Cho/Cr ratio correlated positively and the NAA/Cho ratio inversely with Ki-67 LI. These findings suggest that the Cho signal in proton MRS reflects cellular proliferation. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there was no significant difference between high (> 2.0, 14 cases) and low (< 2.0, 9 cases) Cho/cr ratio groups.

Title: [Radiation induced glioblastoma: a case report].
Abstract: We report a surgical case of a 54-year-old woman with a radiation induced glioblastoma. At the age of 34, the patient was diagnosed to have a non-functioning pituitary adenoma. It was partially removed followed by 50 Gy focal irradiation with a 5 x 5 cm lateral opposed field. Twenty years later, she suffered from rapidly increasing symptoms such as aphasia and right hemiparesis. MRI showed a large mass lesion in the left temporal lobe as well as small mass lesions in the brain stem and the right medial temporal lobe. These lesions situated within the irradiated field. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed relatively high lactate signal and decreased N-acetyl aspartate, choline, creatine and phosphocreatine signals. Increased lactate signal meant anaerobic metabolism that suggested the existence of a rapidly growing malignant tumor. Thus, we planned surgical removal of the left temporal lesion with the diagnosis of a radiation induced malignant glioma. The histological examination revealed a glioblastoma with radiation necrosis. MIB-1 staining index was 65%. Postoperatively, her symptoms improved, but she died from pneumonia 1 month after the surgery. An autopsy was obtained. The lesion of the left temporal lobe was found to have continuity to the lesion in the midbrain, the pons and the right temporal lobe as well. High MIB-1 staining index suggested that a radiation induced glioblastoma had high proliferative potential comparing with a de novo and a secondary glioblastoma.

Title: Global HDO uptake in human glioma xenografts is related to the perfused capillary distribution.
Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate the existence of a possible relationship between global deuterium-labeled water (HDO) uptake rates and the diffusion geometry of human glioma xenografts in nude mice. HDO diffusion times in the whole extravascular tumor volume were estimated by combining quantitative (1)H-MR diffusion imaging and morphometric analysis of intercapillary distances in two tumor lines with a different perfused vascular architecture. HDO uptake was measured independently using (2)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Time constants of HDO-uptake curves (tau) were compared to estimations of maximum HDO diffusion times (t(difmax)). Tumors with a homogeneously perfused capillary distribution showed a mono-exponential HDO uptake. The t(difmax) was comparable to tau values of HDO uptake curves: t(difmax) varied between 74 and 368 sec and the range of tau values was 115-370 sec. Heterogeneously perfused tumors had a bi-exponential HDO uptake with t(difmax) in between the tau values of the fast and slow uptake phase. These findings indicate that the global HDO uptake is related to the perfused capillary distribution in human glioma xenografts. That HDO uptake rates indeed can depend on the perfused capillary distribution was substantiated in experiments with two-dimensional (2D) models. In these models with a diffusion-limited HDO uptake, HDO uptake curves could be approximated by curves derived from 2D HDO diffusion simulations. Magn Reson Med 42:479-489, 1999.

Title: Absence of thallium-201 brain uptake in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in AIDS patients.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of thallium-201 brain uptake determined by thallium-201 brain SPECT (Tl-201 SPECT) in patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and AIDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six AIDS patients with stereotactic biopsy diagnosis of PML were prospectively evaluated with Tl-201 SPECT, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Tl-201 SPECT results were compared with 2 patients with AIDS and biopsy proven primary CNS lymphoma. RESULTS: In all patients with PML, Tl-201 SPECT studies showed lack of uptake while MRI demonstrated subcortical white matter focal brain lesions and 1H-MRS disclosed metabolic abnormalities. Intense thallium uptake (uptake ratios of 3.2 and 5.6) was demonstrated in the 2 patients with primary CNS lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that PML lesions are not detectable on Tl-201 SPECT while MRI and 1H-MRS demonstrate abnormalities, and intense thallium-201 uptake may be detected in primary CNS lymphoma. These results suggest that Tl-201 SPECT is a method which, combined with other non-invasive techniques such as MRI and 1H-MRS, may help in the diagnostic approach of PML and to differentiate PML from other high proliferative brain lesions characterized by positive thallium uptake.

Title: In vivo observation of lactate methyl proton magnetization transfer in rat C6 glioma.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements of the lactate methyl proton in rat brain C6 glioma tissue acquired in the presence of an off-resonance irradiation field, analyzed using coupled Bloch equation formalism assuming two spin pools, demonstrated the occurrence of magnetization transfer. Quantitative analysis revealed that a very small fraction of lactate (f = 0.0012) is rotationally immobilized despite a large magnetization transfer effect. Off-resonance rotating frame spin-lattice relaxation studies demonstrated that deuterated lactate binds to bovine serum albumin and the proteins present in human plasma, thereby providing a possible physical basis for the observed magnetization transfer effect. These results demonstrate that partial or complete saturation of the motionally restricted lactate pool (as well as other metabolites) by the application of an off-resonance irradiation field, such as that used for water presaturation, can lead to a substantial decrease in resonance intensity by way of magnetization transfer effects, resulting in quantitation errors.

Title: Brain biopsy using high-field strength interventional magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Lesions within the brain are commonly sampled using stereotactic techniques. The advent of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now allows neurosurgeons to interactively investigate specific regions, with exquisite observational detail. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of this new surgical approach. METHODS: Between January 1997 and June 1998, 35 brain biopsies were performed in a high-field strength interventional MRI unit. All biopsies were performed using MRI-compatible instrumentation. Interactive scanning was used to confirm accurate positioning of the biopsy needle within the region of interest. Intraoperative pathological examination of the biopsy specimens was performed to verify the presence of diagnostic tissue, and intra- and postoperative imaging was performed to exclude the presence of intraoperative hemorrhage. Recently, magnetic resonance spectroscopic targeting was used for six patients. RESULTS: Diagnostic tissue was obtained in all 35 brain biopsies and was used in therapeutic decision-making. Histological diagnoses included 28 primary brain tumors (12 glioblastomas multiforme, 9 oligodendrogliomas, 2 anaplastic astrocytomas, 2 astrocytomas, 1 lymphoma, and 1 anaplastic oligodendroglioma), 1 melanoma brain metastasis, 1 cavernous sinus meningioma, 1 cerebral infarction, 1 demyelinating process, and 3 cases of radiation necrosis. In all cases, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was accurate in distinguishing recurrent tumors (five cases) from radiation necrosis (one case). No patient sustained clinically or radiologically significant hemorrhage, as determined by intraoperative imaging performed immediately after the biopsy. One patient (3%) suffered transient hemiparesis after a pontine biopsy for investigation of a brain stem glioma. Another patient developed scalp cellulitis, with possible intracranial extension, 3 weeks after the biopsy; this condition was effectively treated with antibiotic therapy. Three patients were discharged on the day of the biopsy. CONCLUSION: Interventional 1.5-T MRI is a safe and effective method for evaluating lesions of the brain. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic targeting is likely to augment the diagnostic yield of brain biopsies.

Title: Inverse correlation between choline magnetic resonance spectroscopy signal intensity and the apparent diffusion coefficient in human glioma.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of human intracranial glioma were studied. Present knowledge suggests a hypothetical inverse relationship between the characteristic choline signal intensity elevation and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in glioma. Twenty cases of glioma were examined with diffusion-weighted echoplanar imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI). A statistically significant inverse correlation between the choline signal intensity and the ADC was found (P = 0.0004) in radiologically defined tumor-containing regions. This study is the first in which diffusion MRI and 1H-MRSI were used to evaluate human intracranial glioma jointly. It provides insight into how to interpret choline signal intensity elevation in terms of tumor cellularity and proliferative potential when ADC images are also available.

Title: Lactate turnover in rat glioma measured by in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Elevated tissue lactate concentrations typically found in tumors can be measured by in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In this study, lactate turnover in rat C6 glioma was determined from in vivo 1H NMR measurements of [3-13C]lactate buildup during steady-state hyperglycemia with [1-13C]glucose. With this tumor model, a narrow range of values was observed for the first-order rate constant that describes lactate efflux, k2 = 0.043 +/- 0.007 (n = 12) SD min-1. For individual animals, the standard error in k2 was small (< 18%), which indicated that the NMR data fit the kinetic model well. Lactate measurements before and after infusing [1-13C]glucose showed that the majority of the tumor lactate pool was metabolically active. Signals from 13C-labeled glutamate in tumors were at least 10-fold smaller than the [3-13C]lactate signal, whereas spectra of the contralateral hemispheres revealed the expected labeling of [4-13C]glutamate, as well as [2-13C] and [3-13C]glutamate, which indicates that label cycled through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the brain tissue. Lack of significant 13C labeling of glutamate was consistent with low respiratory metabolism in this glioma. It is concluded that lactate in rat C6 glioma is actively turning over and that the kinetics of lactate efflux can be quantified noninvasively by 1H NMR detection of 13C label. This noninvasive NMR approach may offer a valuable tool to help evaluate tumor growth and metabolic responsiveness to therapies.

Title: Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy studies on NH4Cl-induced metabolic alterations and detoxification processes in primary astrocytes and glioma cells.
Abstract: Glutamine synthesis, the major pathway of ammonia detoxification, and the intracellular concentration of organic osmolytes in primary astrocytes and F98 glioma cells were investigated with multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Acute exposure to ammonia (3 h incubation with NH4Cl) raised the concentration of glutamine and other amino acids, such as glutamate and aspartate, and decreased myo-inositol, hypotaurine, and taurine concentrations. The loss of these osmolytes was partially reversed by co-treatment with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor, methionine sulphoximine. Glutamate, the precursor of glutamine, is provided by stimulated anaplerotic flux via pyruvate carboxylase and glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Thus, the glutamine increase and myo-inositol decrease observed by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy on patients with hepatic encephalopathy may be due to the disturbed osmoregulation in astrocytes caused by accumulation of glutamine and the subsequent loss of organic osmolytes.

Title: Glucose and lactate metabolism in C6 glioma cells: evidence for the preferential utilization of lactate for cell oxidative metabolism.
Abstract: 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to investigate the metabolism of L-lactate and D-glucose in C6 glioma cells. The 13C enrichment of cell metabolites was examined after a 4-h incubation in media containing 5.5 mM glucose and 11 mM lactate, each metabolite being alternatively labelled with either [1-13C]D-glucose or [3-13C]L-lactate. The results indicated that exogenous lactate was the major substrate for oxidative metabolism. They were consistent with the concept of the existence of 2 pools of both lactate and pyruvate, of which 1 pool was closely connected with exogenous lactate and oxidative metabolism, and the other pool was closely related to glycolysis and disconnected from oxidative metabolism. The molecular basis of this behaviour could be related to different locations for the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, as suggested by their immunohistochemical labelling.

Title: Quantitative 1H nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion spectroscopy of BT4C rat glioma during thymidine kinase-mediated gene therapy in vivo: identification of apoptotic response.
Abstract: We have investigated the effects of thymidine kinase-mediated gene therapy in a malignant rat BT4C glioma by using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo. Ganciclovir has been successfully used in thymidine kinase gene therapy as treatment for various experimental malignancies. The cell damaging effect seems to be mediated by apoptosis, optimally leading to eradication of tumor tissue. In this study, we show that ganciclovir treatment of tumors transfected with the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene causes profound changes in water, metabolites, and macromolecules observable by diffusion spectroscopy. During treatment, a 50% reduction from 0.14 +/- 0.01 x 10(-9) m2/s in the apparent diffusion coefficient of choline-containing compounds can be observed, concomitant with a 219% increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient of the rapidly diffusing water component. These changes are associated with an increase in the relative fraction of this water component from 87 to 94%. The apparent diffusion coefficients of the slowly diffusing water component and macromolecules remain unaltered. The results imply a reduction in cell size and number, a significant increase in intracellular viscosity, and a possible reduction in the hydrodynamic radii of macromolecular components, which are ascribed as biophysical signatures for apoptotic cell death.

Title: Early radiation effects in highly apoptotic murine lymphoma xenografts monitored by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectra (31P-MRS) were obtained from highly apoptotic murine lymphoma xenografts before and up to 24 hr following graded doses of radiation ranging from 2 to 30 Gy. Radiation-induced apoptosis was also estimated up to 24 hr by scoring apoptotic cells in tumor tissue. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Highly apoptotic murine lymphoma cells, EL4, were subcutaneously transplanted into C57/BL mice. At 7 days after transplantation, radiation was given to the tumor with a single dose at 3, 10, and 30 Gy. The beta-ATP/Pi, PME/Pi, and beta-ATP/PME values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. Radiation-induced apoptosis was scored with counting apoptotic cells on hematoxylin and eosin stained specimens (% apoptosis). RESULTS: The values of % apoptosis 4, 8, and 24 hr after radiation were 21.8, 19.6, and 4.6% at 3 Gy, 35.1, 25.6, and 14.8% at 10 Gy, 38.4, 38.0, and 30.6% at 30 Gy, respectively (cf. 4.4% in control). There was no correlation between early change in beta-ATP/Pi and % apoptosis at 4 hr after radiation when most of the apoptosis occurred. An early decrease in PME/Pi was observed at 4 hr after radiation dose at 30 Gy. For each dose, the values of beta-ATP/Pi 24 hr after radiation were inversely related to radiation dose. CONCLUSION: The increase in beta-ATP/Pi observed by 31P-MRS was linked to the degree of histological recovery from radiation-induced apoptosis.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy guided brain tumor resection: differentiation between recurrent glioma and radiation change in two diagnostically difficult cases.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is often difficult to differentiate a recurrent glioma from the effects of post-operative radiotherapy by means of conventional neurodiagnostic imaging. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI), that allows in vivo measurements of the concentration of brain metabolites such as choline-containing phospholipids (Cho), may provide in vivo biochemical information helpful in distinguishing areas of tumor recurrence from areas of radiation effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients who had undergone resection and post-operative radiotherapy for a cerebral glioma became newly symptomatic. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the intravenous infusion of contrast material, and in one case, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), could not differentiate between the possibilities of recurrent glioma and radiation effect. The patients underwent 1H-MRSI prior to reoperation and the 1H-MRSI results were compared to histological findings originating from the same locations. RESULTS: A high Cho signal measured by 1H-MRSI was seen in areas of histologically-proven dense tumor recurrence, while low Cho signal was present where radiation changes predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The differentiation between the recurrence of a cerebral glioma and the effects of post-operative irradiation was achieved using 1H-MRSI in these two patients whose conventional neurodiagnostic imaging was equivocal for such a distinction. Where these two conditions are present, metabolite images from 1H-MRSI, such as that based on Cho, can be co-registered with other imaging modalities such as MRI and may also be integrated with functional MRI or functional PET within a multimodal imaging-guided surgical navigation system to assure maximal resection of recurrent tumor while minimizing the risk of added neurological damage.

Title: Assignment of glial brain tumors in humans by in vivo 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and multidimensional metabolic classification.
Abstract: This study presents a simple approach for the noninvasive assignment of glial brain tumors according to malignancy by single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at short echo times (TE < or = 50 milliseconds). Based on peak area ratios, a five-dimensional data set was obtained for each investigated subject. This vector was then projected along metabolic coordinates in a two-dimensional metabolic space. These coordinates had been determined in a previous study (Hagberg G et al., 1995, Magn Reson Med 34: 242-252). Tumor assignment was done without any knowledge of histology by comparing the location of the new cases to the features of the previous study. All 11 investigated glioblastomas multiforme, as well as 4 of 5 astrocytomas grade II, could easily be assigned to the groups of high- and low-grade tumors, respectively. Classification was more difficult in the case of a cystic astrocytoma grade II and one astrocytoma grade III. Two spectra measured in normal-appearing matter of glioblastoma patients were not classified as healthy. Using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at short echo times with the knowledge of a base study, a straightforward, fast, and noninvasive differential diagnosis of glial brain tumors is possible.

Title: Pretreatment prediction of the chemotherapeutic response of human glioma cell cultures using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
Abstract: Both tumor metabolism and its response to cytotoxic drugs are intrinsic properties of tumor cells. It is therefore likely that there is a relationship between the two properties, however subtle and complex, wherein the metabolic characteristics of tumor cells can reflect the inherent response (resistance or sensitivity) of these cells to cytotoxic drugs. We used artificial neural network analysis to show that it is possible to distinguish, prior to treatment, between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive human glioma cell cultures from their metabolic profiles, as given by high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the cell extracts, and to predict their cellular response to the chemotherapeutic drug 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea in vitro. The results suggest that neural network analysis of tumor nuclear magnetic resonance spectra has potential as a prognostic tool for determining treatment of gliomas, ultimately noninvasively, and may be used to provide information about the metabolic pathways involved in drug response that may be helpful in developing novel treatments for these tumors.

Title: Serial proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging of glioblastoma multiforme after brachytherapy.
Abstract: The utility of three-dimensional (3-D) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging for detecting metabolic changes after brain tumor therapy was assessed in a serial study of 58 total examinations of 12 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who received brachytherapy. Individual proton spectra from the 3-D array of spectra encompassing the lesion showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation necrosis, recurrent or residual tumor, or normal brain. The 1H-MRS imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or recurrent tumor and contrast-enhancing radiation-induced necrosis. Regions of abnormally high choline (Cho) levels, consistent with viable tumor, were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 gliomas. Changes in the serial 1H-MRS imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following treatment. These changes included the significant reduction in Cho levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to necrotic tissue. For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical progression, an increase in Cho levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or necrotic. Several patients showed regional variations in response to brachytherapy as evaluated by 1H-MRS imaging. This study demonstrates the potential of noninvasive 3-D 1H-MRS imaging to discriminate between the formation of contrast-enhancing radiation necrosis and residual or recurrent tumor following brachytherapy. This modality may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to brachytherapy by detecting the presence of abnormnal metabolite levels in nonenhancing regions of solid tumor.

Title: The accumulation of H-1 MR-visible lipid in human glioma cells is independent of the cell cycle.
Abstract: The human glioma cell line, 2607, was observed with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the presence of a number of cell-cycle blockers (cysteamine, desferrioxamine, ADR 529). MR spectra of the arrested cells revealed a correlation between the intensity of the lipid methylene resonance at 1.3 ppm and the percentage of cells in G(2)/M. However, subsequent time course studies using ADR 529 on cells partially synchronised by contact inhibition showed that the emergence of the lipid signal in drug-treated cells is not strictly cell cycle dependent but increases with continuing exposure to ADR 529. This indicates that the accumulation of MR-visible lipid arises from drug cell interactions that specifically affect lipid metabolism in a non cell cycle dependent manner.

Title: In vitro and in vivo MRS study of human glioma metabolites.
Abstract: In this study an in vitro multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) characterization of water soluble metabolites and of the lipid fraction obtained from 19 human gliomas (12 glioblastomas, 3 anaplastic astrocytomas, 2 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and 2 oligodendrogliomas) with a total of 27 surgical specimens, is reported. Moreover, some in vivo H-1 MRS results are shown. The regional metabolic heterogeneity of glioblastomas, according to their morphological heterogeneity, is documented. For glioblastomas a specific in vitro H-1 MRS metabolite profile cannot be defined. Low and high grade oligodendrogliomas showed characteristic choline/creatine and alanine/creatine metabolite ratios. The spectroscopical characterization of histopathological factors concerning malignant gliomas is shown.

Title: Proton and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of human brain tumor extracts with automatic data classification: a preliminary study.
Abstract: High-resolution one-dimensional proton and phosphorus and two dimensional COSY proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy were used to investigate the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism of human brain tumors. Sixteen meningioma (MG) (benign tumors) and ten glioblastoma (GB) (malignant tumors) samples from brain surgery were treated for dual extraction of lipidic and aqueous phases before NMR processing. A highly significant variation of the 1H metabolite spectral pattern was observed between benign and malignant tumors. Double extraction method combined with both 1H and 31P NMR in vitro analyses provided a large set of biochemical information which may be statistically analyzed to elucidate tumor-specific biochemical pathways and to improve interpretation of in vivo spectra.

Title: [31P-MR spectroscopy of the human liver--the spectral indications of lymphoma infiltration].
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate whether phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) enables a non-invasive detection of liver involvement in systemic diseases like Hodgkin's lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a clinical 1.5 Tesla whole-body MR system image-guided localised phosphorus MR spectra from the anatomically defined volumes of interests were measured. A combination of surface coil, adiabatic excitation pulse and modified image-selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS)-sequence was applied. The spectroscopy data were evaluated quantitatively with a time-domain fit programme using non-linear optimisation algorithms to quantify peak areas. After establishment of the examination protocol, 22 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with suspected lymphoma infiltration of the liver were examined. RESULTS: Liver spectra of patients suffering from lymphoma infiltration differed significantly from spectra of persons with normal liver: 1. The peak area ratio of phosphomonoesters (PME) to beta-NTP was elevated in all patients with histologically confirmed liver lymphoma. 2. Patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease with specific or unspecific liver infiltration (n = 7) could be differentiated from patients without liver involvement. In case of infiltrated liver, the peak area ratio PME to beta-NTP was increased, and the pH value was shifted to lower values. Unambiguous differentiation between non-specific (n = 3) and specific (n = 4) infiltration of the liver was not possible. 3. In patients after cytostatic treatment (n = 3), an increase of the peak area ratio of inorganic phosphate to beta-NTP was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that 31P-MRS can yield pointers to liver involvement in patients with systemic diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, which may be hardly detected by imaging methods.

Title: Current perspectives in gliomas.
Abstract: The annual incidence of primary central nervous system tumors, including gliomas, is increasing, however, the prognosis of these tumors remains poor with a median survival of only 5 years. The imaging of tumors by computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and newer methods such as positron emission tomography and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is increasing our knowledge of tumor biology and extent of the disease. Advances within the field of neurosurgery have improved operative procedures reducing mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, radiotherapy planning, tumor targeting and repositioning for treatment have all improved initial tumor management. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial. Chemotherapy for advanced and recurrent disease has been extensively investigated, and although improvements in quality of life have been recorded, no prolongation of survival has been documented. With new discoveries and increasing knowledge of the physiology and molecular biology of these tumors the potential for targeting therapy at a genetic level is becoming increasingly promising. This review provides an overview of these current perspectives in glioma management.

Title: Early changes in peritumorous oedema and contralateral white matter after dexamethasone: a study using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: AIMS: To study the mechanism of action of steroids in patients with peritumorous oedema. METHODS: To investigate early cerebral metabolic changes proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used before and 11 to 14 hours after treatment with dexamethasone (12 mg oral loading and 4 mg four times daily maintenance). Nine patients (two men, seven women, mean age 54) with pronounced oedema associated with various intracranial tumours (two astrocytomas, three meningiomas, two glioblastoma, and two metastases) were examined using MRI and MRS. SE1500/135 volume selected MRS (mean volume 21 ml) were performed on an oedematous region and a contralateral region. All spectra were acquired with and without water suppression. Metabolite peak area ratios were determined. RESULTS: Regions of oedema had significantly (P < 0.01) higher unsuppressed water than the contralateral regions, as expected. There was no change at this early time point after dexamethasone. The ratio of the area of choline containing compounds to that creatine and phosphocreatine compounds was determined after which the serial ratios of these before and after were calculated (a serial ratio of 1.0 would indicate no change in the choline to creatine ratios after steroid administration). The mean serial ratios for the area of oedema were 1.02 (SEM 0.08) and 1.10 (0.08) for the contralateral volume of interest, indicating no significant changes. However, significant changes (P < 0.02) were found in the N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA)/choline serial ratios (0.86 (0.06) in the area of oedema, 1.20 (0.10) in contralateral brain) and the NAA/creatine serial ratios (0.86 (0.08) for the oedema, 1.25 (0.11) in contralateral brain). CONCLUSIONS: Such rapid changes may be explained either by relatively large alterations in the relaxation characteristics of NAA or, more controversially, by actual changes in the amounts of NAA. It is proposed that steroids act primarily by causing early metabolic changes that are later expressed in improvements in intracranial volume relations.

Title: Determination of de novo synthesized amino acids in cellular proteins revisited by 13C NMR spectroscopy.
Abstract: 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine the absolute amounts to de novo synthesized amino acids in both the perchloric acid extracts and the hydrolyzed protein fractions of F98 glioma cells incubated for 2 h with 5 mmol/l [U-13C]glucose. 13C NMR spectra of the hydrolyzed protein fraction revealed a marked incorporation of 13C-labelled alanine, aspartate and glutamate into the proteins of F98 cells within the incubation period. Additionally, small amounts of 13C-labelled glycine, proline and serine could unambiguously be identified in the protein fraction. Astonishingly, approximately equal amounts of 13C-labelled glutamate and aspartate were incorporated into the cellular proteins, although the cytosolic steady-state concentration of aspartate was below 13C NMR detectability. Hypertonic stress decreased the incorporation of 13C-labelled amino acids into the total protein, albeit their cytosolic concentrations were increased, which reflects an inhibition of protein synthesis under these conditions. On the other hand, hypotonic stress increased the amount of 13C-labelled proline incorporated into the cellular proteins even though the cytosolic concentration of 13C-labelled proline was largely decreased. Apparently, hypoosmotic conditions stimulate the synthesis of proteins or peptides with a high proline content. The results show that already after 2 h of incubation with [U-13C]glucose there is a pronounced flux of 13C label into the cellular proteins, which is usually disregarded if cytosolic fluids are examined only. This means that calculations of metabolic fluxes based on 13C NMR spectroscopic data obtained from perchloric acid extracts of cells or tissues and also from in vivo measurements consider only the labelled 'NMR visible' cytosolic metabolites, which may have to be corrected for fast label flowing off into other compartments.

Title: Differentiation of cerebral radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) was evaluated for distinguishing between radiation necrosis and recurrent glioma in 11 patients after high-dose radiotherapy. Six patients had a histological diagnosis of recurrent glioma. Four patients had a histological diagnosis of radiation necrosis and one had a clinical course consistent with the diagnosis of radiation necrosis. 1H MRS showed cases of radiation necrosis had two characteristic 1H MRS patterns: markedly increased lactate/creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr) ratio and decreased choline-containing compounds/Cr ratio compared to that of recurrent glioma; or all the major metabolites were completely diminished. The N-acetyl aspartate signal was not helpful for differential diagnosis. 1H MRS is a potentially useful method for differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis in patients treated for malignant glioma.

Title: Brain stem involvement in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: role of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in the distinction from diffuse pontine glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to distinguish neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1) with brain stem enlargement from diffuse pontine glioma (PG) in pediatric patients. METHODS: A chart review was used to identify all patients with NF-1 and diffuse brain stem enlargement who were seen at our institution and who had undergone MRI. Comparison groups were as follows: 1) eight patients who did not have NF-1 but who did have diffuse PG, and 2) seven healthy children. Midsagittal diameters of the pons, midbrain, and medulla were measured in all patients, and the results were statistically analyzed. Two MRS variables were also statistically compared: N-acetyl aspartate and the vector sum of the metabolites choline and creatine/phosphocreatine. RESULTS: In MRI-based measurements, only the pontine midsagittal diameter differed significantly between the NF-1 and PG groups (P = 0.002). Altogether, 21 children underwent MRS, including 6 in the NF-1 group. Measures of both MRS variables were significantly lower in patients with PG than in the others (P < or = 0.007). The two MRS variables classified the 21 children into the three respective groups with 100% accuracy. Of the seven patients with NF-1, four presented with symptoms attributable to brain stem involvement. The brain stems of all seven patients with NF-1 were hyperintense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, and five were isointense on T1-weighted images; only one exophytic tumor was identified. Four of the patients with NF-1 were followed up clinically without treatment; all remained alive and neurologically stable for a median of 40 months. All eight patients in the PG group were symptomatic at presentation, and all except one died despite therapy. CONCLUSION: Both MRI measurements and MRS seem to be useful for distinguishing patients with NF-1 and diffuse brain stem enlargement from patients without NF-1 but with diffuse PG. They should be most helpful in differentiating symptomatic patients with NF-1 from patients with PG, thereby minimizing aggressive treatment and its side effects in patients destined to have better outcomes.

Title: Absolute concentrations of metabolites in human brain tumors using in vitro proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Water-soluble metabolites extracted from 60 surgically excised samples of various brain tumors and four nontumorous lobectomized brains were measured quantitatively using in vitro high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A detailed MR spectrum-histology correlation study in a glioblastoma was made, to reveal MR spectral changes in accordance with the density of glioma cells. Furthermore, three cases that had difficult preoperative diagnoses are discussed. MR spectra from gliomas exhibited characteristic patterns according to malignancy, presumably reflecting its metabolic effects. Concentrations of choline-containing compounds, inositol, alanine, glycine and phosphorylethanolamine (PEA) increased according to the degree of malignancy, but it was noteworthy that in glioblastoma the choline-containing compounds, inositol, alanine, glycine and phosphorylethanolamine increased according to the degree of malignancy. In particular, the glycine concentration was very high in glioblastoma. We also detected a large amount of taurine in medulloblastoma. Although the total creatine concentrations decreased according to the malignancy, the concentration of total creatine was relatively preserved in neuroectodermal tumors but was low in nonneuroectodermal tumors. N-acetyl-aspartate was unequivocally demonstrated in normal tissues, but could not be detected in nonneuroectodermal brain tumors such as metastatic brain tumor, meningioma, neurinoma and chordoma. In meningioma, although a high peak of choline-containing compounds has been reported uniquely by in vitro and in vivo 1H-MRS, we demonstrated that its concentration was not increased in meningioma; instead, there was an increased alanine content. 1H-MRS of neurinoma demonstrated high inositol peaks, and a large amount of inositol. The reason for the high inositol content in neurinoma is unknown, but the prominent peak of inositol on MR spectra should be useful for the differential diagnosis of neurinoma from meningioma. PEA concentration was increased four to five times in pituitary adenoma, malignant lymphoma, and medulloblastoma as compared with normal brain. Thus 1H-MRS might provide clinically useful information on tumor malignancy and characteristic tumor metabolism. Although excellent anatomical information of tumors can be readily obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. MRS provides metabolic information. MRS may provide additional information in cases in which the differential diagnosis of tumors by neuroimaging is difficult.

Title: Potential role of in vitro 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the definition of malignancy grading of human neuroepithelial brain tumours.
Abstract: The increasing sensitivity of neuro-imaging in the diagnosis of brain expanding lesions is not directly related to biopathological specificity and new technological approaches are under study. In particular Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) allows evaluation of some biochemical pathways whose metabolic alterations may be correlated with the nature and malignancy grading of primary brain tumours. In the present study the author performed an in vitro high field 1H MRS (9.4 and 14.1 T) analysis of specimens obtained from stereotactic biopsy or microsurgical removal of primary brain tumours. Different samples derived from heterogeneous areas and/or infiltrated perilesional regions were examined. This study was principally focused on malignancy grading of gliomas and its correlation with the ratio (R) between the resonance band arising from choline containing compounds (between 3.14 and 3.35 ppm) and the total creatine signal (3.0 ppm). Analyses allowed significant discrimination between astrocytomas (R = 2.4 +/- 0.6) and glioblastoma (GBM) (R = 4.4 +/- 1.3) [p < 0.002]; however the results did not allow discrimination between differentiated and anaplastic astrocytomas. The GBM showed the largest spread of values corresponding to their higher level of tissue heterogeneity and de-differentiation. Studies on non astrocytic brain tumours indicated that even higher R values were exhibited by oligodendrogliomas, even in well differentiated forms (p < 0.02 with respect to GBM). Moreover, preliminary observations indicated that signals arising from other metabolites may also contribute to a differential diagnosis of different oncotypes. Among these glycine appears particularly relevant, since higher levels were measured for this amino acid in GBM with respect to both astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.

Title: In vivo (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and morphometric analysis of the perfused vascular architecture of human glioma xenografts in nude mice.
Abstract: The relationship between the bioenergetic status of human glioma xenografts in nude mice and morphometric parameters of the perfused vascular architecture was studied using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), fluorescence microscopy and two-dimensional digital image analysis. Two tumour lines with a different vascular architecture were used for this study. Intervascular distances and non-perfused area fractions varied greatly between tumours of the same line and tumours of different lines. The inorganic phosphate-nucleoside triphosphate (P(i)/NTP) ratio increased rapidly as mean intervascular distances increased from 100 microm to 300 microm. Two morphometric parameters - the percentage of intervascular distances larger than 200 microm (ivd200) and the non-perfused area fraction at a distance larger than 100 microm from a nearest perfused vessel (area100), - were deduced from these experiments and related to the P(i)/NTP ratio of the whole tumour. It is assumed that an aerobic to anaerobic transition influences the bioenergetic status, i.e. the P(i)/NTP ratio increased linearly with the percentage of ivd200 and the area100.

Title: Evaluation of the effects of immunosuppressants on neuronal and glial cells in vitro by multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: The use of the undecapeptide cyclosporine and the macrolide tacrolimus as immunosuppressants in transplantation medicine and for the therapy of immune diseases often provokes side effects, among the most important one is neurotoxicity. Changes in the cellular metabolism of glial cells (C6 rat glioma), neuronal cells (N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma) and primary glia cells (isolated from rats) after addition of cyclosporine and tacrolimus were investigated using 1H-, 13C- and 31P-NMR spectroscopy in vitro. Cells were exposed to various concentrations of the drugs from 3 h to 42 days. The immunosuppressants (cyclosporine IC50 : 55 mumol/l; tacrolimus IC50 : 47 mumol/l) inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. Multinuclear NMR studies of PCA extracts of drug-treated cells showed a significant deterioration in the energy status (a decreasing level of PCr : -46 +/- 11%; an increasing NDP/NTP ratio: +136 +/- 4% and an increasing level of Pi : +248 +/- 15%; mean +/- standard deviation). It also showed decreasing concentrations of major cell metabolites like NAA (-59 +/- 12%) in neuroblastoma cells and myo-inositol (-47 +/- 6%) in glia cells compared with untreated controls. Immunosuppressive treatment caused a large reduction of taurine (-36 +/- 12%) and glutamate (-68 +/- 10%) in all cell cultures, whereas intermediates of phospholipid biosynthesis (PE: +59 +/- 13%; PC: +127 +/- 27%;) and breakdown (GPE: +215 +/- 24%; GPC: +245 +/- 17%) increased. No significant differences were observed between the two immunosuppressants. The toxic effects of immunosuppressants on cell cultures are in line with MRI studies of brain oedema observed in patients under immunosuppressive treatment.

Title: Synthesis of a glioma-related ganglioside, O-Ac GM3 having 3-O-Ac ceramide and its substrate property toward hydrolases.
Abstract: An O-acetyl group was selectively introduced into the ceramide moiety at the C-3-O on ganglioside GM3 containing N-acetyl neuraminic acid, the product of which has been previously found in rat glioma tissue as a glioma-associated ganglioside. The introduction of the acetyl residue involved a two-step process involving per O-acetylation of GM3 and saponification with a mild alkaline solution in a bilayer system constituted of water and water-immiscible organic solvent. Of the several solvents studied, 2-pentanol and diethyl ether gave the highest yields (68% and 62%, respectively). The chemical structure of the synthesized 3-O-acetyl GM3 was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, as well as by comparing the mobilities on thin-layer chromatography of its exoglycosidase-digested products with those of the synthesized, authentic 3-O-acetyl-lactosylceramide and ceramide. Furthermore, the substrate specificities of both 3-O-acetyl GM3 and 3-O-acetyl sphingomyelin toward exo- and endo-hydrolases were examined, revealing that they were hardly cleaved by the endoglycoceramidase and sphingolipid N-deacylase for the 3-O-acetyl GM3 and by sphingomyelinase for 3-O-acetyl sphingomyelin. Thus, the enzymes were found to recognize a free C-3 hydroxyl group on ceramide.

Title: Proton chemical shift imaging, metabolic maps, and single voxel spectroscopy of glial brain tumors.
Abstract: Seventeen patients with presumed glial brain tumors were examined with proton chemical shift imaging and single voxel spectroscopy that used different echo times. Metabolite resonances were evaluated by metabolic ratios and absolutely by correcting for coil load and comparison to phantom measurements. Metabolic images were created to visualize the metabolic changes. All patients showed spectra that were different from those measured in healthy control subjects. Spectral changes were also present in normal-appearing matter (NAM) that was distant from lesions. The resonance at 3.55 ppm which is usually assigned to both myo-inositol and glycine, was the only one to allow a discrimination between healthy volunteers, astrocytoma grade II, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (p < 0.02). From the different echo times used we conclude that an increase in this resonance has to be assigned to glycine rather than myo-inositol. This resonance might be used to grade human gliomas more reliably. Total creatine (Cr) decreased more drastically with malignancy than N-acetylated metabolites (NA). This led to a higher NA/Cr ratio in GBM compared to astrocytoma grade II. NA/Cr was thus pseudonormal in GBM due to a change in both nominator and denominator. This study reveals the importance of comparing magnetic resonance spectroscopy data of lesions to spectra measured in identical localizations in healthy control subjects instead of NAM and the importance of quantifying single metabolic peaks instead of creating metabolic ratios in clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Title: Detection of apoptotic cell death by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Cells undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death) display profound morphologic and biochemical changes in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. We have shown a direct temporal relationship between the onset of apoptosis in Jurkat T-cell lymphoblast cultures and a greater than two-fold increase in the signal intensity of the methylene resonance (at 1.3 ppm) as observed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). The increase in the methylene resonance intensity was seen when apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation, glucocorticoid, and doxorubicin treatment but not in necrotic (nonapoptotic) cell death. We have found similar changes in a variety of other cell lines undergoing apoptosis including the Hut 78 T-cell leukemia, JY natural killer T-cell leukemia, Daudi B-cell lymphoma, HeLa, and 3T3 fibroblast cell lines. Furthermore, this spectral change was diminished in Bcl-2 overexpressing HL-60 cell cultures treated with doxorubicin, which were relatively resistant to apoptosis, as compared to apoptotic HL-60 cultures. 1H NMR spectroscopy therefore may be useful in detecting apoptotic cell death in vivo.

Title: Imaging methods as a diagnostic tool in neuro-AIDS. A review.
Abstract: Since 1983, central nervous system (CNS) involvement in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is well recognized. Imaging methods are important in diagnosing AIDS-related primary and secondary CNS processes as HIV-1-associated encephalopathy, cerebral toxoplasmosis, primary CNS lymphoma, cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and infectious spinal cord granulomas. This paper presents a review of typical AIDS-related CNS findings as seen in morphological radiologic techniques, i.e. cranial computed tomography (CCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, the paper discusses the value of CCT, MRI and functional (positron emission computed tomography = PET, single-photon emission computed tomography = SPECT, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy) as well as morphometric imaging methods in evaluating subclinical HIV-1-related cerebral deficits and predicting their clinical course.

Title: One-dimensional phosphorus-31 chemical shift imaging of human brain tumors.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used noninvasively to determine characteristic spectral parameters for untreated human brain tumors as a prelude to its use in clinical diagnosis. METHODS: The spectra, which reflect the relative amounts of phosphorus-containing compounds, and the pH within and surrounding the tumors, were obtained in vivo using the localization technique of one-dimensional chemical shift imaging applied with a surface coil. Phosphorus-31 chemical shift imaging was performed successfully in vivo on 9 volunteers and 27 patients with untreated brain tumors, including 7 with astrocytoma, 4 with glioblastoma, 3 with meningioma, and 11 with metastases. This study provides spectra from within and surrounding the brain tumors, and allows accountability for the heterogeneity of brain tumors by the selection of the maximum data point for each parameter. RESULTS: The ratios of resonance areas, phosphodiesters over nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), and phosphomonoesters over NTP, were found to be higher in glioblastomas (2.55 +/- 0.22, 1.06 +/- 0.09) and astrocytomas (3.04 +/- 0.36, 1.28 +/- 0.36) than in normal brain (2.00 +/- 0.32, 0.79 +/- 0.22). The ratios of areas due to inorganic phosphate and NTP, and phosphocreatine and NTP, also were higher in astrocytomas (1.16 +/- 0.40, 1.17 +/- 0.41) compared with glioblastomas (0.68 +/- 0.01, 0.88 +/- 0.19) and normal brain (0.61 +/- 0.03, 0.77 +/- 0.03). The pH of brain tumors ranged from alkaline to neutral, with meningiomas consistently having alkaline pH. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that there are statistically significant differences in the magnetic resonance parameters of the affected brain hemispheres of patients with astrocytomas, glioblastomas, meningiomas, and normal brain tissue, and underline the need for a multisite clinical trial to establish clinical criteria for diagnosis.

Title: Non-invasive characterization of brain tumor by in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: We studied the feasibility of characterizing brain tumor tissue by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Twenty-six newly diagnosed tumors were examined by in-vivo 1H-MRS. The NAA (N-acetylaspartate)/Cho (choline) ratio of Grade 2 astrocytoma was higher than that of Grade 4. The Cho/Cr (creatine and phosphocreatine) ratio of meningioma was considerably higher than that of glioma of all grades. We have experienced only two cases of ependymoma and the Cho/Cr ratios of both were lower than that of glioma. It seems likely that 1H-MRS can be used to differentiate Grade 2 from Grade 4 in most cases of astrocytoma based on the NAA/Cho ratio, though a few cases will overlap. Meningioma can be distinguished easily from glioma, and the results of our study suggest that ependymoma shows a characteristic pattern on 1H-MRS, different from those of other brain tumors.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for the evaluation of treatment of brain tumours.
Abstract: We investigated metabolic changes in brain tumours following treatment, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In meningiomas, effective therapeutic embolisation led to an acute increase in lactate. In radiosensitive tumours such as malignant lymphoma, a decrease in lactate and in increase in N-acetyl-aspartate occurred after radiotherapy, which preceded changes observed on magnetic resonance imaging. On the other hand, no significant changes in spectral patterns were observed in malignant gliomas resistant to therapy. Tissue characterisation of brain tumours by spectral patterns on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy remains controversial. However, we have shown it to be sensitive to metabolic changes following treatment, which may reflect the efficacy of the therapy.

Title: Cell type-specific fingerprinting of meningioma and meningeal cells by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: We compared the properties of six human meningiomas with normal rat meningeal cells using cell culture techniques, high resolution in vitro 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, and chromatographic analysis. Cell cultures were immunocytochemically characterized at all stages with specific antibodies. Quantitative and qualitative metabolite assessments in cell extracts were obtained from 1H-NMR spectra and chromatographic analysis. Human meningioma cells expressed a characteristic spectrum of metabolites including free amino acids, compounds related to membrane phospholipid metabolism, energy metabolites, and other intermediary products. These spectral characteristics, although different in some respects, were strikingly similar to the ones of rat meningeal cells. Particularly, several metabolites that allow discrimination between meningeal cells and other cell types of the central nervous system were preserved in meningiomas. These similarities suggest that the regulation of intracellular levels of such metabolites is so intrinsic to the identity of cell type as to be conserved across species and through transformation. Additionally, human meningioma cultures expressed some spectroscopic characteristics that enabled them to be clearly distinguished from primary rat meningeal cultures. Thus, human meningiomas may be both specifically recognizable by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and also distinguishable from normal rat meningeal tissue. Our results raise the eventual possibility of using NMR in the noninvasive diagnosis of brain tumors in vivo.

Title: Proton MRS similarity between central nervous system non-Hodgkin lymphoma and intracranial tuberculoma.
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was carried out on a patient with histologically proven non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the central nervous system (CNS). The observation of the presence of a huge resonance in the region between 0.5-1.5 ppm and the absence of any other signals is not in agreement with those published for NHL in the literature but has a striking similarity to that reported for an intracranial tuberculoma.

Title: Oxidation therapy: the use of a reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme system for tumour treatment.
Abstract: Oxygen radicals induce cytotoxicity via a variety of mechanisms, including DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Here, we explore the use of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-stabilised enzyme capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), glucose oxidase (GO), for the purpose of harnessing the cytotoxic potential of ROS for treating solid tumours. PEG-GO (200 U), administered by two intratumoral injections 3 h apart, produced a significant growth delay in subcutaneous rat 9L gliomas as compared with control animals receiving heat-denatured PEG-GO. Rats were protected from systemic toxicity by subsequent i.v. administration of PEG-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) and PEG-catalase. In vivo tumour metabolic changes, monitored using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) 6 h following initial administration of PEG-GO, revealed a 96 +/- 2% reduction in the ATP/Pi ratio and a 0.72 +/- 0.10 unit decline in intracellular pH. A 3-fold sensitisation of 9L glioma cells in vitro to hydrogen peroxide could be achieved by a 24 h preincubation with buthionine sulphoximine (BSO). This study suggests that oxidation therapy, the use of an intratumoral ROS-generating enzyme system for the treatment of solid tumours, is a promising area which warrants further exploration.

Title: Phosphorylethanolamine content of human brain tumors.
Abstract: Phosphorylethanolamine (PEA) is the major component of the phosphomonoester peak detected by phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, but the absolute concentration has not been determined. This study measured the PEA concentration in biopsy specimens of brain tumors and lobectomized cerebral cortex using high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of PEA was 118.5 +/- 10.0 mumol/100 g wet wt in cortex, and was significantly higher in malignant gliomas, metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and neurinoma. The concentration of PEA was especially high in pituitary adenoma, malignant lymphoma, and medulloblastoma.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain tumors: an in vitro study.
Abstract: The ability of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to diagnose brain tumors was investigated using in vitro high-resolution spectra. Fifty-eight surgically excised samples of brain tumors (12 glioblastomas, 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, 6 astrocytomas, 12 meningiomas, 6 neurinomas, 4 chordomas, 3 craniopharyngiomas, 2 pituitary adenomas, 2 malignant lymphomas, 1 ependymoma, 1 medulloblastoma, and metastatic brain tumors including 3 pulmonary adenocarcinomas, a hepatocellular carcinoma, and a renal cell carcinoma) and 4 nontumorous lobectomized brains were examined by in vitro 1H MRS. N-Acetyl-aspartate was demonstrated in normal tissues but could not be detected in nonneuroectodermal tumors. Total creatine was decreased in all brain tumors in comparison with normal brain tissues, but was relatively higher in neuroectodermal tumors than in other brain tumors. Choline-containing compounds were present in all tumors except craniopharyngioma, and their concentrations were particularly high in a metastatic brain tumor from hepatocellular carcinoma. The concentration of glycine was high in neuroectodermal tumors, whereas that of taurine was high in medulloblastoma, pituitary adenoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Alanine was increased in meningioma, glioma, and pituitary adenoma. Neurinoma had the largest inositol content among the tumors examined. Thus each type of brain tumor exhibited a characteristic MR spectrum. These data suggested that in vivo 1H MRS might provide clinically useful information about tumor metabolism and aid in the differential diagnosis of tumors. Although excellent anatomical localization of tumors can be readily obtained by MR imaging, MRS may provide additional information in cases in which the differential diagnosis of tumors by MR imaging is difficult.

Title: In vitro and in vivo 13C and 31P NMR analyses of phosphocholine metabolism in rat glioma cells.
Abstract: In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has revealed that phosphomonoesters (PME) such as phosphocholine (PCho) and phosphoethanolamine (PEth) are elevated in tumors and rapidly proliferating tissues. The regulation of PME levels and their relationship to proliferation are not well known. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of PCho and PEth levels in rat glioma cells grown in vivo and in vitro using 31P and 13C MRS. However, the ability of cells to produce choline endogenously is variable. To fully understand regulation of PCho levels, it is necessary to characterize the activity of the endogenous pathway, if it exists. This was first investigated by following the metabolic fate of 13C-labeled methionine of 9L glioma tumors in vivo. Our results indicate that there is a significant amount of de novo choline synthesis in vivo. However, similar experiments performed in vitro using cells cultured in bioreactors indicated that glioma cells themselves are unable to synthesize choline de novo, suggesting that the in vivo results were due to the involvement of extra-tumoral organs, e.g., liver. Further in vitro experiments demonstrated that the uptake and phosphorylation of physiologically relevant concentrations of exogenous choline is very active in these systems. Thus, it appears that the exogenous pathway for PCho biosynthesis predominates and regulates PCho levels in glioma cells. Our results also demonstrate that PCho levels are lowest, and PEth levels are highest, in non-proliferating cells. These observations indicate that there is a decrease in the biosynthesis of PCho concomitant with a reduction in culture growth. The source of the increased PEth is, as yet, undefined.

Title: 31-P MR spectroscopy and MRI of a testicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma recurrence to monitor response to irradiation. A case report.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To monitor the metabolic changes during the radiation treatment of a recurrence of a high malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the left testis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 76-year old patients who presented a diffuse centroblastic high malignant NHL recurrence in the left scrotal sac was examined with 31-P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before, during and after megavoltage radiotherapy to a total dose of 56 Gy. RESULTS: The 31-P MRS spectrum of the tumor showed before starting irradiation, intensive phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals that overlapped the inorganic phosphate (Pi) signal. After 26 Gy irradiation, the Pi peak appeared and revealed an intratumoral pH of 7.08 very close to that in the normal testis (pH of 7.02). After 56 Gy the tumor disappeared and a complete remission was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. 31-P MRS is sensitive to the changes in the tumor metabolic activity after irradiation with a dose of 26 Gy. 2. Pi and PME peaks could be good pathological markers in the steady-state response to irradiation. 3. MRI could confirm the radiation induced tumor regression and the achieved clinical complete remission.

Title: Measurement of amino acid metabolism derived from [1-13C]glucose in the rat brain using 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: To clarify the unique characteristics of amino acid metabolism derived from glucose in the central nervous system (CNS), we injected [1-13C]glucose intraperitoneally to the rat, and extracted the free amino acids from several kinds of tissues and measured the amount of incorporation of 13C derived from [1-13C]glucose into each amino acid using 13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). In the adult rat brain, the intensities of resonances from 13C-amino acids were observed in the following order: glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and alanine. There seemed no regional difference on this labeling pattern in the brain. However, only in the striatum and thalamus, the intensities of resonances from [2-13C]GABA were larger than that from [2,3-13C]aspartate. In the other tissues, such as heart, kidney, liver, spleen, muscle, lung and small intestine, the resonances from GABA were not detected and every intensity of resonances from 13C-amino acids, except 13C-alanine, was much smaller than those in the brain and spinal cord. In the serum, 13C-amino acid was not detected at all. When the rats were decapitated, in the brain, the resonances from [1-13C]glucose greatly reduced and the intensities of resonances from [3-13C]lactate, [3-13C]alanine, [2, 3, 4-13C]GABA and [2-13C]glutamine became larger as compared with those in the case that the rats were sacrificed with microwave. In other tissues, the resonances from [1-13C]glucose were clearly detected even after the decapitation. In the glioma induced by nitrosoethylurea in the spinal cord, the large resonances from glutamine and alanine were observed; however, the intensities of resonances from glutamate were considerably reduced and the resonances from GABA and aspartate were not detected. These results show that the pattern of 13C label incorporation into amino acids is unique in the central nervous tissues and also suggest that the metabolic compartmentalization could exist in the CNS through the metabolic trafficking between neurons and astroglia.

Title: Meningioma phospholipid profiles measured by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Fourteen cases of intracranial meningioma were characterized after chloroform/methanol extraction by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at 202.4 MHz. Each phospholipid class detected in the extracts was identified and quantitated in terms of its molar percentage relative to the total phospholipids measured. The following phospholipids were assayed by 31P NMR: phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, diphosphatidylglycerol, ethanolamine plasmalogen, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingosylphosphorylcholine and phosphatidylcholine. In addition, two unidentified phospholipids were detected with resonances at 0.13 and -0.78 ppm, respectively. Three distinct types of spectra were obtained on the extracts and grouped accordingly for comparison purposes. Type 1 tumors showed unusual 31P NMR profiles with low levels of PE and PI and elevated levels of LPC; type 2 tumors were characterized by low levels of the ethanolamine phospholipids and near equivalent levels of PI and LPC. The spectra of type 1 and type 2 tumors were characteristic of degenerative cells that lacked membrane permeability associated with loss of ethanolamine plasmalogen in the presence of significant phospholipid turnover. Meningiomas belonging to the third spectral type showed characteristics similar to those of normal tissues with normal levels of PE and ethanolamine plasmalogen, as well as very low levels of LPC relative to PI. Type 3 tumors lacked the characteristic signs of degeneration noted in type 1 and type 2 tumors. The data corroborate and augment in vivo spectroscopic findings reported earlier and demonstrate the value of 31P NMR spectroscopic phospholipid analysis on lipid extracts for the characterization of meningiomas.

Title: Phosphorus metabolism during growth of lymphoma in mouse liver: a comparison of 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo and in vitro.
Abstract: Large phosphomonoester (PME) signals are detected in the phosphorus magnetic resonance spectra (31P MRS) of many neoplastic and rapidly dividing tissues. In addition, alterations in phosphodiester (PDE) signals are sometimes seen. The present study of a murine lymphoma growing in liver showed a positive correlation between the hepatic PME/PDE ratio measured in vivo by 31P MRS at 4.7 T and the degree of lymphomatous infiltration in the liver, quantified by histology. High-resolution 31P MRS of liver extracts at 9.7 T showed that the PME peak consists largely of phosphoethanolamine (PE) and to a lesser extent of phosphocholine (PC). The concentration of both PE and PC increased positively with lymphomatous infiltration of the liver. In vivo, the PDE peak contains signals from phospholipids (mostly phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) and the phospholipid breakdown products glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) and glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Low levels of GPE and GPC were detected in the aqueous extracts of the control and infiltrated livers; their concentrations remained unchanged as the infiltration increased. The total concentration of phospholipids measured by 31P MRS of organic extracts decreased about 3-fold as the infiltration increased to 70%. Thus, our data showed that the increased PME/PDE ratio in vivo is due to both an increase in the PME metabolites and a decrease in the PDE metabolites. We propose that this ratio can be used as a non-invasive measure of the degree of lymphomatous infiltration in vivo.

Title: Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy of small ring-enhancing lesions using a rat glioma model.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to demonstrate the usefulness of proton and fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in characterizing small ring enhancing lesions produced by experimental malignant gliomas. METHODS: The growth characteristics of a rat glioma model (RT2) were studied using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans of the tumors and histologic correlates obtained at various times. Changes in tumor metabolite levels were monitored on a serial basis using water-suppressed proton spectroscopy. The existence of tumor hypoxia was established using 19F MRS in combination with a fluorinated nitroimidazole and subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections. RESULTS: Ring-enhancing lesions are produced by RT2 rat brain gliomas approximately 7 days after intracerebral implantation. Beginning at day 5, marked deviations in brain metabolite levels are observed on proton MR spectra. However, while the signal from the fluorinated nitroimidazole is first detected by 19F MRS at day 7, immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections reveals bound drug as early as day 5, when the first histologic signs of necrosis become apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging of RT2 rat brain glioma exhibits ring-enhancing characteristics similar to those observed in clinical studies. The appearance of the ring enhancement corresponds with the development of central necrosis and could serve as an indicator for rapid growth. Proton and fluorine MRS may be useful in confirming that a small ring-enhancing lesion represents an active tumor process early in its development.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy: Application to Experimental Neuro-Oncology.
Abstract: The development and use of animal brain tumor models over the past 25 years has helped to advance our understanding of both tumor biology and the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches. The application of MRI and MRS as noninvasive tools for in vivo studies of intracerebral tumor models provides unique possibilities for furthering our knowledge of brain cancer. This article provides a brief background of traditional techniques used to evaluate growth and treatment efficacy in rodent brain tumor models and overviews the use of MR for quantitating intracerebral tumor growth kinetics and therapeutic response of experimental brain tumors from work conducted in this laboratory. The application of MRI and MRS in rodent brain tumor models for evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches, including gene transfer technology, is discussed. Finally, initial results with diffusion MRI for monitoring the treatment of brain tumors is introduced.

Title: In vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an intracerebral glioma in rat brain: assignment of resonances.
Abstract: An in vivo study of intracerebral rat glioma using proton-localized NMR spectroscopy showed important modifications of the spectra in the tumor as compared with the contralateral brain. To carry out the assignment of the resonances of the glioma spectra, tumoral and normal rat brain tissues were studied in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro by one-dimensional and two-dimensional proton spectroscopy. N-Acetylaspartate was found at an extremely low level in the glioma. The change of peak ratio total creatine/3.2 ppm peak was found to be due to a simultaneous decrease of the total creatine content and an increase of the 3.2 ppm peak. The 3.2 ppm resonance in the glioma spectra has been shown to originate from choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, taurine, inositol, and phosphoethanolamine. The increase of the 3.2 ppm peak in the glioma was found to result from the increase of taurine and phosphoethanolamine contents. The peak in the 1.3 ppm region of the glioma spectra was due to both lactate and mobile fatty acids. Moreover, two-dimensional spectroscopy of excised tissues and extracts showed the presence of hypotaurine only in the tumor.

Title: Effects of therapy on the 1H NMR spectrum of a human glioma line.
Abstract: Currently it is difficult to predict the efficacy of any therapeutic modality in individual patients. If it could be shown that successful therapy causes some chemical alteration in the tumor before gross alteration in size becomes radiologically visible, the therapeutic regimen could potentially be modified, sparing the patients longer trials of ineffective therapy. We used proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect the presence of simple metabolites (such as lactic acid, creatine/phosphocreatine, N-acetyl aspartate, and the "choline" pool) in extracts of a human glioma grown subcutaneously in athymic ("nu/nu") mice. By comparing the tumor spectra obtained from untreated mice with tumor spectra from mice treated with chemotherapy or irradiation, we have shown a significant decrease in the lactate/creatine and lactate/choline values in tumors of similar size following treatment. Such information could prove valuable as a means of monitoring tumor therapy when obtained noninvasively from spatially localized in vivo spectra.

Title: Brain abscess observed by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: We encountered a case of brain abscess that was difficult to differentiate from glioblastoma. Localized 1H-MRS was found to be useful for obtaining information on the biochemical status of brain abscess. The peak of lipid and high residual peak of NAA (N-acetyl-aspartate) were observed in the cystic lesion of the brain abscess by 1H-MRS. The NAA/Cho (Choline-containing compounds) ratio in brain parenchyma showing an edematous lesion before therapy gradually increased with the relief of inflammation.

Title: Inhibitory effects of ascorbic acid on growth of leukemic and lymphoma cell lines.
Abstract: Vitamin C has been suggested and disputed as an anti-cancer agent. Previous in vitro studies using either primary cell cultures from cancer patients or tumor cell lines have suggested that tumor cells with different lineages may have different sensitivities to ascorbic acid. In this study we report characterization of the effects of ascorbic acid on growth of two ascorbic acid sensitive and one ascorbic acid resistant lymphocyte tumor cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of ascorbic acid on the sensitive cell lines were time and dosage dependent. Furthermore, the energy state of the ascorbic acid sensitive cells was affected by the presence of ascorbic acid before the cells became apparently non-viable, as demonstrated by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The existence of these lymphocyte cell lines with varying sensitivities to ascorbic acid may provide a useful model system for further understanding of vitamin C action on cancer cells.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of astrocytic tumors: an in vitro study.
Abstract: Water-soluble metabolites extracted from 20 astrocytic tumors (11 glioblastomas, 3 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 6 low-grade astrocytomas) and four normal brains were measured qualitatively and quantitatively using in vitro high-resolution proton magnetic resonance (1H-MR) spectroscopy. MR spectra from tumors exhibited characteristic patterns according to malignancy, presumably reflecting the metabolism of gliomas. Concentrations of choline-containing compounds, inositol, alanine, and glycine increased according to the malignancy, while that of total creatine decreased. In particular, glycine concentration was very high in glioblastoma, and an immunohistochemical study using anti-glycine antibody demonstrated that glycine was mainly distributed in glioma cells, not in proliferative endothelial cells. The ratios of choline-containing compounds and glycine to total creatine are useful parameters for grading gliomas, and the ratio of glycine to total creatine is useful for the differential diagnosis of glioblastoma from metastatic tumor. Such indications appearing in in vivo 1H-MR spectroscopy might provide clinically useful information on tumor metabolism and malignancy, and help assess the effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy on gliomas.

Title: Phospholipid synthesis in the lymphomatous mouse liver studied by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vitro and by administration of 14C-radiolabelled compounds in vivo.
Abstract: High phosphomonoester to ATP ratios have been found in 31P magnetic resonance spectra from livers of patients with hepatic lymphoma (Dixon et al. (1990) Br. J. Cancer 63, 953-958). The present study of a murine lymphoma showed that the phosphomonoester in the lymphomatous liver was largely phosphoethanolamine, which is an intermediate of phospholipid metabolism. A significant positive correlation was found between the concentration of phosphoethanolamine, measured by high resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of extracts, and the degree of infiltration, assessed by quantitative histology. The phosphoethanolamine concentration reached about 10 times its normal level, but the phosphocholine concentration remained the same as in the normal liver. Radiolabelling studies showed that while the rate of phosphoethanolamine synthesis from exogenous [14C]ethanolamine was higher in the lymphomatous mouse liver than in control livers, the rate of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis was lower in the lymphomatous liver. The rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in lymphoma-bearing livers was not significantly different from that in control mouse livers.

Title: Mapping of brain tumor metabolites with proton MR spectroscopic imaging: clinical relevance.
Abstract: Brain tumor metabolism was studied with hydrogen-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in 50 patients. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was generally decreased in tumors and radiation necrosis but was somewhat preserved at neoplasm margins. Choline was increased in most solid tumors. Solid high-grade gliomas had higher normalized choline values than did solid low-grade gliomas (P < .02), but the normalized choline value was not a discriminator of tumor grade, since necrotic high-grade lesions had reduced choline values. Serial studies in one case showed an increase in choline as the glioma underwent malignant degeneration. Choline values were lower in chronic radiation necrosis than in solid anaplastic tumors (P < .001). In two cases studied before and after treatment, clinical improvement and a reduction in choline followed therapy. Lactate is more likely to be found in high-grade gliomas, but its presence is not a reliable indicator of malignancy.

Title: Regional metabolism in experimental brain tumors in cats: relationship with acid/base, water, and electrolyte homeostasis.
Abstract: Experimental brain tumors were produced in cats by xenotransplantation of the rat glioma clone F98 into the white matter of the left hemisphere. One to 4 weeks after implantation, local adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glucose, lactate, and tissue pH were measured via imaging techniques in cryostat sections passing through the center of the tumor and correlated with changes in water and electrolyte content. The tumors exhibited a heterogeneous metabolic pattern, with a tendency for ATP to decrease and lactate to increase during tumor development. Tissue pH was above 7.5 in tumors with high ATP content but it sharply declined at low ATP levels. In peritumoral edema, ATP also decreased and lactate increased but, in contrast to tumor tissue, pH became more alkaline. Metabolic changes were associated with edema formation, as evidenced by the rise in water and sodium content. There was a distinct difference between tumor tissue and peritumoral edema: in tumor tissue, pH declined with increasing water content, whereas in peritumoral edema it increased. These observations are interpreted as follows: 1) in tumor tissue, "lactacidosis" and ATP depletion are attributed to disturbances in blood flow, resulting in metabolic failure and the intracellular "cytotoxic" accumulation of water; 2) in peritumoral edema, "lactalkalosis" is the result of an efflux of (alkaline) lactate salts from the tumor into the expanded extracellular compartment, and the decrease in ATP is the volumetric effect of extracellular "vasogenic" edema fluid and not the result of cellular energy failure. These findings are of importance for the interpretation of volume-selective magnetic resonance spectroscopy and may contribute to the establishment of spectroscopic criteria for the evaluation of therapeutical interventions.

Title: Spatially localized in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an intracerebral rat glioma.
Abstract: Surface coil MRI combined with spatially localized spectroscopy was used to noninvasively detect 1H signals from metabolites within an intracerebral malignant glioma in rats. The MRS pulse sequence was based upon two-dimensional ISIS, which restricted 1H signals to a column-shaped volume, combined with one-dimensional spectroscopic imaging, which further resolved the signals into 8 or 16 slices along the major axis of the column. All experiments were executed with adiabatic pulses which induced uniform spin excitation despite the inhomogeneous radiofrequency field distribution produced by the surface coil transmitter. Surface coil MRI and MRS experiments were performed on phantom samples, normal rat brains, and rat brains harboring malignant gliomas. Spatially resolved in vivo 1H spectra of intracerebral gliomas revealed significantly decreased concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate and creatine and increased lactic acid (or lipids) as compared to the contralateral hemisphere. These results demonstrate that metabolic abnormalities in intracerebral rat gliomas can be spatially resolved in a noninvasive manner using localized in vivo 1H MRS.

Title: Tumour pH and response to chemotherapy: an in vivo 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy study in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Abstract: Serial image-localized 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies were performed in nine patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) during the early part of treatment with chemotherapy. The pre-treatment intracellular pH (pHi) of the tumours ranged from 6.97 to 7.61 for high-grade NHL (n = 3), and 7.16 to 7.39 for low-grade NHL (n = 5). A pH of 7.24 was recorded in a patient with intermediate-grade NHL. Slice-to-slice variation in tumour pHi in spectra obtained with a one-dimensional chemical shift imaging (1D-CSI) technique varied from zero to 0.5 pH units. The largest variation was seen in high-grade tumours. Slice-to-slice variation may reflect tumour heterogeneity. Alkaline shifts in tumour pHi of 0.14 to 0.45 pH units were seen in six patients following chemotherapy. Maximal change in tumour pH was related temporally to increases in the phosphodiester/beta-adenosine triphosphate ratio, and occurred before alterations in tumour size were documented. Cell death and necrosis may be associated with an alkaline shift in pHi due to cessation of H(+)-producing processes and release of basic components of proteins. An alkaline shift in tumour pHi may therefore be an early metabolic marker of response to chemotherapy.

Title: Abnormal phosphomonoester signals in 31P MR spectra from patients with hepatic lymphoma. A possible marker of liver infiltration and response to chemotherapy.
Abstract: Hepatic infiltration by lymphoma can be difficult to detect by conventional methods. We have studied 22 patients in vivo 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liver and compared the results with the clinical staging and assessment of liver involvement by computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and liver function tests (LFTs). We find that the phosphomonoester (PME) to ATP, and the PME to Pi ratios are the best indication of liver involvement as in all the patients with liver involvement apparent on CT or US, these ratios were elevated (greater than 2 s.d. above the control mean). Of the patients with deranged LFTs but normal CT or US, five out of nine showed increased PME/ATP and PME/Pi ratios, and in the patients with normal LFTs and normal CT or US, three out of eight patients had raised PME ratios. Extracts of lymphomatous lymph nodes contain high concentrations of phosphoethanolamine which suggests that this compound is responsible for the increase in the PME peak. Eleven patients were studied again after chemotherapy, and those with initially raised PME/ATP and PME/Pi ratios all showed a decrease in these ratios towards normal. The patients with initially normal ratios showed no changes.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and metabolism. Applications of proton and 13C NMR to the study of glutamate metabolism in cultured glial cells and human brain in vivo.
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to study the metabolism of cells from the central nervous system both in vitro on perchloric acid extracts obtained either from cultured tumoral cells (C6 rat glioma) or rat astrocytes in primary culture, and in vivo within the human brain. Analysis of carbon 13 NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts prepared from cultured cells in the presence of NMR [1-13C] glucose as substrate allowed determination of the glutamate and glutamine enrichments in both normal and tumoral cells. Preliminary results indicated large changes in the metabolism of these amino acids (and also of aspartate and alanine) in the C6 cell as compared to its normal counterpart. Localized proton NMR spectra of the human brain in vivo were obtained at 1.5 T, in order to evaluate the content of various metabolites, including glutamate, in peritumoral edema from a selected volume of 2 x 2 x 2 cm3. N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate, phosphocreatine, creatine, choline and inositol derivative resonances were observed in 15 min spectra. N-acetyl-aspartate was found to be at a lower level in contrast to glutamate which was detected at a higher level in the injured area as compared to the contralateral unaffected side.

Title: [In vivo 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy of liver diseases].
Abstract: 31P-MR spectroscopy was performed in 12 patients with focal and diffuse liver disease and in ten normal controls, using surface coils. Results so far show a significantly increased concentration of PME/beta-ATP and of PDE/beta-ATP in patients with liver metastases and in one patient with hepatic involvement by malignant lymphoma. The spectra of liver cirrhosis and fatty livers showed no characteristic changes.

Title: Hexose monophosphate shunt measurement in cultured cells with [1-13C]glucose: correction for endogenous carbon sources using [6-13C] glucose.
Abstract: Hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) activity can be measured with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or gas chromatography--mass spectrometry by monitoring the differential production of [3-13C]lactate and [3-12C]lactate from the degradation of [1-13C]-glucose. Errors in measurement of HMPS activity can arise from unlabeled lactate precursors, by recycling of HMPS products, and by incomplete fractional enrichment of labeled glucose. A method utilizing cultured cells incubated with [1-13C]glucose in parallel with incubations using [6-13C]glucose to correct for all these problems is presented. In cultured rat C6 glioma and 9L gliosarcoma cells, failure to apply this correction results in an approximately twofold overestimation of HMPS activity.

Title: The assessment of treatment response in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by image guided 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Serial image guided 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies were performed in eight patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to determine the changes in phosphorus metabolites that occur in vivo in response to chemotherapy. Pre-treatment spectral characteristics were different in high and low grade lymphoma. A larger inorganic phosphate (Pi) peak was seen in high grade NHL relative to phosphomonoesters (PME) or beta adenosine triphosphate (beta ATP), producing significant differences in the PME/Pi and Pi/beta ATP metabolite ratios, and probably reflecting a larger hypoxic cell fraction within the high grade lymphomas. Consistent metabolite changes were seen with treatment, and before reductions in tumour bulk had occurred. Alterations in tumour energetics with changes in Pi and beta ATP, and increases in phospholipid turnover reflected as an increase in the phosphodiester (PDE) resonance were detected. Changes were seen between days 10 and 27 in low grade lymphoma treated with oral alkylating therapy and between days 1 and 5 in lymphoma treated with intensive combination chemotherapy. Increases in the PDE/beta ATP metabolite ratio may be an early indicator of response to chemotherapy in human tumours. These studies illustrate the feasibility and clinical potential of image guided 31P MRS as a means of assessing response to therapy.

Title: Regulation of the cytidine phospholipid pathways in human cancer cells and effects of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine: a noninvasive 31P nuclear magnetic resonance study.
Abstract: Using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we have noninvasively observed metabolic control through the cytidine pathways of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in intact actively metabolizing MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Perfusion with the phospholipid precursors ethanolamine or choline (2 mM) indicates that the cytidylyltransferase enzymes are rate limiting for both pathways. Complete inhibition of choline kinase with ethanolamine allowed the observation of the utilization of phosphocholine by the rate-limiting enzyme choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. The rate was dependent on the phosphocholine concentration. Inhibition of glycerophosphorylcholine phosphodiesterase with accumulation of substrate was also observed and allows an estimate of the flux through the degradative pathways. The human lymphoma cell line MOLT-4 was also found to contain high levels of phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine. The levels of these precursors in the MOLT-4 line are lowered by 40% after 6 h when perfused with high dose 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) (400 microns) but are unaffected by 2 microns Ara-C or dideoxycytidine. High dose Ara-C also resulted in lysis in 8-10 h. However, the MDA-MB-231 cell line which is not sensitive to Ara-C showed no change in its spectrum when perfused with Ara-C. A potential mechanism based on classic phospholipid metabolism for the lytic effect of high dose Ara-C is discussed.

Title: [CNS involvement in neurofibromatosis. A postmortem study].
Abstract: Neurofibromatosis was recorded from 30 in 82,249 postmortem cases (0.036%) at the Medical Academy of Erfurt, Institute of Pathological Anatomy, between June 1, 1945 and December 31, 1986, among them 13 cases of classical peripheral neurofibromatosis generalisata Recklinghausen (NgR) and 17 with CNS involvement. These had been 10 males and 7 females who had died at an age from 8 to 77 years (average age and death being 39 years). CNS lesions were preferentially localised in periventricular sections of the third and fourth ventricles and the cerebral aquaeduct, with diffuse gliosis being recorded from 5 cases. Typical bilateral neurofibromatosis of the acoustic nerve was established from three males aged 19, 26 and 30 years. Spinal neurinoma or neurofibroma, meningioma, an astrocytoma of the cervical spinal cord, and leptomeningeal sarcomatosis were also recorded. Additional skeletal abnormalities were exhibited by four cases. Interest is generally growing in CNS involvement in neurofibromatosis due to the possibility of intravital diagnosis by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI) and because of possible surgical therapy. Recent studies in molecular genetics, on the other hand, have shown classical NgR to be caused by a lesion to chromosome 17, while bilateral neurofibromatosis of the acoustic nerve was found to be based on a genetic defect to the long arm of chromosome 22.

Title: Characterization of the spleen by in vivo image guided 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: Image localized 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the spleen was performed in six normal volunteers, 13 patients with splenomegaly due to haematological malignancies, and two patients with benign causes of splenomegaly. The malignant disorders had elevated phosphomonoesters (PME) compared to controls, probably due to increased turnover of membrane phospholipids, with variable alterations in high energy phosphates. There appeared to be no relationship between grade of malignancy and relative PME peak area. An overlap in spectral characteristics between the benign and malignant cases of splenomegaly existed. Serial studies in a patient with high grade lymphoma receiving combination chemotherapy showed changes in phosphorus spectra, with an increase in the phosphodiester/beta adenosine triphosphate ratio.

Title: Human primary brain tumour metabolism in vivo: a phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study intracellular pH and compounds which contain phosphorus in normal human brain and primary brain tumours non-invasively. In normal subjects (n = 7) intracellular pH (pHi) of the brain was 7.03 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- s.e.m.). The pHi did not vary between superficial (2 cm, majority grey matter) and deep brain (5 cm, majority white matter). The relative concentrations of phosphocreatine (PCr) and phosphomonoesters (PME) to ATP were also constant with depth. The relative concentration of phosphodiesters (PDE) increased from superficial to deep in normal brain. The astrocytomas (n = 7, grade II-IV) were significantly more alkaline (pHi = 7.08 +/- 0.03), and contained more PCr and PME, with respect to ATP, than normal brain at similar depth. The meningiomas (n = 4) were also more alkaline (pHi = 7.19 +/- 0.02) with a raised PME level but reduced PCr. The reduction in meningioma PCr may be due to the significant necrosis (greater than 20%) seen in the surgical biopsies. No significant necrosis was seen in the gliomas. Previous in vitro studies suggest that increased PME may be due to accumulation of phosphoethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid precursor. These results suggest that human primary brain tumours characteristically are more alkaline with increased PME than normal brain.

Title: 31P-spectroscopy of head and neck tumors--surface coil technique.
Abstract: Comparative phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 15 patients with superficial masses such as sarcoma, carcinoma, lymphoma, adenoma, and tuberculosis revealed significant increased concentrations of phosphomonoester, phosphodiester, and inorganic phosphorus in the lesion, whereas the concentration of the phosphocreatine was lower in comparison to muscle tissue. In nearly all masses, pH showed a slight alkaline shift. Existence of necrotic regions detected by MRI was marked by an increase of inorganic phosphorous in the spectra. Tumor growth was characterized by raised concentrations of phosphomonoester. Follow-up studies in a case of lymphoma showed a six-fold decrease of the tumor, while the spectra indicated a gradual transition of tumor values to muscle values. A follow-up study during irradiation of a squamous cell carcinoma revealed a considerable decrease of inorganic phosphate and a subsequent increase of phosphodiester.

Title: Effect of dimethylsulfoxide on human gliomas: correlations between the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and the transformed phenotypes of the tumor cells.
Abstract: Prolonged in vitro induction of six established human glioma cell lines with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) generated an adherent human fibroblastoid phenotype. The development of contact-inhibited cell growth coincided with the decreased colony-forming potential of these cells in semisolid medium and with the reduction or elimination of tumorigenicity when transplanted in athymic nude mice. These DMSO-induced changes persisted for at least 19 passages after removal of the inducer from the medium. High-resolution natural-abundance 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed specific spectral differences between the cell lines with more or less malignant transformed phenotypes: the glioma cells with a higher degree of tumorigenicity and colony-forming potential exhibited more intense myoinositol signals than those with the more benign phenotype.

Abstract: Simultaneous 31P-MR spectroscopy (MRS) and MR imaging (MRI) of 10 patients suffering from superficial tumours like carcinoma, lymphoma and adenoma, revealed significantly enhanced concentrations of phosphomonoester, phosphodiester and inorganic phosphorus in the tumour, whereas the concentration of phosphocreatine was lower in comparison to muscle tissue. In all tumours the pH showed a slight alkaline shift. The existing of necrotic regions detected by MRI was accompanied by an increase of inorganic phosphorus in the spectra. A follow-up study of a patient with a lymphoma during chemotherapy showed a tumour regression, whereas the spectra indicated a continuous approach of tumour values to the muscle values.

Title: Use of phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy to monitor response to chemotherapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Abstract: Two patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the femur were examined with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and proton magnetic resonance imaging before and during treatment with chemotherapy. Prior to treatment, 31P MRS of the tumor showed that in comparison to normal skeletal muscle, phosphocreatine was reduced, and phosphomonoesters (PME) and phosphodiesters were elevated. The 31P spectrum became similar to that of normal muscle after 40 days of treatment in both cases. Following the initial dose of chemotherapy, an increase in PME relative to adenosine triphosphate was observed within 48 h in one patient. Magnetic resonance showed a change in the soft tissue component of both tumors and 6-12 months later there was no clinical evidence of any recurrence. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy with 31P may prove to be a sensitive technique for monitoring therapeutic response of tumors.

Title: In vivo 31P MRS in new antineoplastic agents evaluation on experimental tumor models.
Abstract: Two new antineoplastic agents, a nitrosourea and a DNA-bis-intercalator have been studied in vivo by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a rat glioma and Walker carcinoma. On rat glioma, spectra are modified when the tumor is treated by the nitrosourea, showing the depletion of high-energy phosphates. On Walker carcinoma both drugs delay the tumor evolution to necrosis, showing important levels of high-energy phosphates on NMR spectra. There appears to be a great dependence upon energy metabolism during chemotherapy, depending on the nature and physiology of the observed tumor.

Title: Carbohydrate metabolism of the rat C6 glioma. An in vivo 13C and in vitro 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.
Abstract: Surface coil 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the in vivo carbohydrate metabolism of rat C6 gliomas during and after infusion with [1-13C] glucose. In vivo 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectra of the glioma following infusion with [1-13C]glucose revealed the direct production of [3-13C]lactic acid, [1-13C]glycogen, and [4-13C], [3-13C], and [2-13C]glutamate/glutamine. Lactate levels of in vivo gliomas increased and reached steady state levels during [1-13C]glucose infusion, and decreased following termination of infusion. Complementary in vitro studies using supernatant media collected from C6 glioma cells incubated with media containing [1-13C] or [6-13C]glucose and glutamine were examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The [3-(13C/12C)]lactate ratios obtained from 1H spectra of supernatant media containing [1-13C]glucose revealed the percentage of glucose metabolized through the hexose monophosphate shunt to be 10.01 +/- 0.85% (n = 3), while similar measurements of media containing [6-13C]glucose and glutamine showed that glutaminolysis contributed 9.0 +/- 1.0% of total lactate production under these conditions. Enzymatic analysis of media determined lactate production to be 139 +/- 9 nmol per 10(6) cells per h (n = 4). These measurements demonstrate the ability of NMR to monitor brain tumor carbohydrate metabolism both in vitro and in vivo.

Title: Metabolic changes in cerebral gliomas within hours of treatment with intra-arterial BCNU demonstrated by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Abstract: A 40-year-old female with a recurrent mixed astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma was treated with intra-arterial BCNU at six week intervals. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed before, and on two occasions after her third treatment. Before treatment, phosphodiesters were 25% less than normal and intracellular pH was 7.14 (normal 6.97 +/- 0.02). Eight hours following treatment phosphocreatine and phosphodiesters were reduced by approximately 40% and pHi increased to 7.24. Thirty-two hours after treatment, phosphocreatine and phosphodiesters had reversed their decline, but pHi had increased further to 7.35. MRI and x-ray CT scans did not show any change during this period. This study demonstrates that chemical changes can be observed in a glioma by magnetic resonance spectroscopy shortly after chemotherapy in a clinical setting and before changes are observable by imaging modalities. This approach evidently offers a possible means of monitoring the acute metabolic response of tumours to chemotherapy or other forms of treatment by a non-invasive repeatable quantitative method.
